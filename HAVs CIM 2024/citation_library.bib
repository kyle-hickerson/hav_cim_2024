Second, the application of surveillance technologies to people is central to the rise of coercive conservation strategies. Third, such technologies enable the creation and commoditization of spectacular nature. Fourth, spatial digital data enables the automation of conservation decisions, a trend described here as ``conservation by algorithm''.}

The extent of convergence of cultural values across nations has been debated by international marketing researchers. However, from a practical standpoint, transnational firms require a cross-national, cross-cultural approach to market segmentation that can be used to guide the development of global marketing strategies. In this study, the authors investigate the application of cross-national versus cross-cultural approaches to market segmentation through a rigorous empirical investigation in the context of banking services. Although services constitute the fastest growing sector of the world economy, few studies have examined global market segmentation strategies for them. The authors develop theory-based cross-national hypotheses and test them by estimating a structural model of consumers' perceived service quality using survey data from two countries: the United States and India. They test cross-cultural hypotheses by estimating the same model on culture-based clusters. They demonstrate that there are distinctive differences between cross-national and cross-cultural models of perceived service quality and highlight the growing relevance of cross-cultural research approaches. More generally, the cross-national, cross-cultural approach to market segmentation can guide the development of global marketing strategies for services and improve business performance.}

However, it is unclear how effective they are against human attackers. We address three factors that challenge the effectiveness of the masking strategies in practice: (1) we relax the assumption of rationality of the attackers made by Game Theory/Machine Learning defense algorithms; (2) we provide a cognitive model of human attackers that can inform these defense algorithms; and (3) we provide a way to generate data on attacker's decisions through simulation with a cognitive model. Two masking strategies of defense were generated using Game Theory and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The effectiveness of these two masking strategies of defense, risk averse and rational, are compared in an experiment with human attackers. We collected attacker's decisions against the two masking strategies. With the limited human participant's data, the results indicate that the risk averse strategy can reduce the defense losses compared to the rational masking strategy. We also propose a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning Theory that accurately represents and predicts the attacker's decisions in this task. We demonstrate the model's process by generating simulated data and comparing it to the attacker's actual actions in the experiment. The model is able to capture the data at the aggregate and at the individual levels of attackers making decisions in both rational and risk averse defense algorithms. We propose that this model can be used to inform game theoretic defense algorithms and to produce synthetic data that can be used by ML algorithms to generate new defense strategies.},

For example, attitude has been an important area in science education, and there have been many attempts to measure students attitudes to understand why they prefer a specific science subject (Reid; 2006). Zimmerman and Brogan (2015) stated that `grit predicts successful performance in a variety of contexts and found to be positively correlated with undergraduate grade average.' Unfortunately, there are very few attempts if any have been studying the effect of grit on students' academic achievement in Bahrain. Bahrain is an important economic sector in the Arabic Gulf region; it has very ambitious and competitive developing economical and educational vision. This study aims to find relationships between students' level of grit and attitudes toward mathematics and science and the academic achievements in Bahrain secondary schools. `Grit questionnaire' was adapted from Duckworth et al. (2007), and was administered to a total of 646 secondary school students. `Attitudes toward mathematics' questionnaire was adapted from TIMSS (2011), and administered to a total of 349 secondary school students. `Attitudes toward science' questionnaire was adapted from TIMSS (2011), and administered to a total of 297 secondary school students. The results showed that grit is positively and significantly correlated to academic achievement in math only, while attitudes towards math and science was positively and significantly correlated to academic achievement in both subjects.}

Our evidence comes from an evaluation of a randomized educational intervention implemented in elementary schools in Istanbul. Outcomes are measured via a novel incentivized real effort task and actual school grades on core subjects. We find that treated students are 1) more likely to choose to undertake a more challenging and more rewarding task against an easier but less rewarding alternative, 2) less likely to give up after failure, 3) more likely to exert effort to accumulate task-specific ability, and consequently, 4) more likely to succeed and collect higher payoffs. The intervention also has a significant impact on school grades: We find that treated students are about 3 percentage points more likely to receive top grades in core academic subjects.}

We used a mixed factorial design to examine the effects of trust and trust violations on human-human and human-robot interactions over time with an emphasis on anthropomorphic robots in a social context. We found consistent and significant effects of partner behavior. Specifically, partner distrust behaviors led to participants' lower levels of trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors over time compared to partner trust behaviors. We found no significant effect of partnering with a human versus an anthropomorphic robot over time across the three dependent variables, supporting the computers as social actors (CASA; Nass and Moon, 2000) paradigm. This study demonstrated that there may be instances where the effects of trust violations from an anthropomorphized robot partner are not meaningfully different from those of a human partner in a social context.},

University student participants (N = 258) responded to an online survey containing demographic items and scales measuring the non-cognitive factors noted above. The results demonstrated that `grit' (i.e. perseverance of effort and consistency of interest) positively associates with academic performance through a sequential pathway of mediators including self-efficacy and achievement orientation goals. Findings supported the positive relationships between mastery, approach goals, and academic performance, as well as the negative association between avoidance goals and academic performance. The model revealed that self-efficacy may play supportive and protective roles by increasing the positive effect of mastery and performance-approach goals and reducing the negative effect of avoidance goals on academic performance, respectively. These novel findings support the contribution of `grit' in predicting various academic outcomes.}

EFA results suggested that a two-factor solution (i.e., perseverance of effort [G‗PE] and consistency of interest [G‗CI]) was the best factorial structure, explaining 47.74\% and 51.02\% of the variance in the Omani and American samples, respectively. The factors had good reliability coefficients in the two samples. Related to the intercultural differences, G‗PE explained more variance among Omanis (31.02\%) relative to American sample, whereas G‗CI explained a larger proportion of variance among Americans (36.86\%) compared with Omani sample. The first level of measurement invariance, configural invariance, was not supported, necessitating the investigation of the other levels of measurement invariance using a new sample. Grit correlated positively with mastery and performance-approach goals (r = .29 and .12, respectively) and negatively with avoidance goals (r = -.25), supporting the scale's construct validity. These findings showed that Grit-S scale can be used as valid and reliable assessment tool to assess student interest and perseverance in the academic context in Arabic/Omani and American cultures.}

  abstract = {Evaluating the effectiveness of defense technologies mandates the inclusion of a human element, specifically if these technologies target human cognition and emotions. One of the biggest challenges that face researchers in the realm of behavioral cybersecurity is participant recruitment. Researchers often rely on college students, the general public, real-world hackers, or a hard-to-reach population (e.g., professional red teamers) to test the effectiveness of cybersecurity defense techniques. However, recruiting participants from these populations has drawbacks, including but not limited to: high cost, time constraints, and manageability and accessibility issues. This research explored the applicability of using two popular crowdsourcing platforms, Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, to conduct web hacking experiments. Our study is the first to use crowdsourcing platforms to run hacking experiments for scientific purposes. While the recruitment is challenging, the paradigm of existing crowdsourcing platforms can be useful for understanding adversarial behavior, as it facilitates access to a diverse set of participants and allows researchers to conduct longitudinal and cross-cultural assessments. In particular, crowdsourcing platforms offer a great opportunity for cybersecurity researchers to investigate the Oppositional Human Factors (OHFs) in a manageable and flexible way.},

Regardless, the concept of grit has been heavily criticised due to the number of inconsistencies among current research. Fully understanding the usefulness of grit in an educational context is a worthwhile pursuit and could yield incredibly influential implications. The current narrative review aimed to address and explore these inconsistencies to determine the true impact of grit on the academic outcomes of school students. Such that, it aimed to establish whether grit was useful in improving outcomes such as academic achievement, attendance and retention. Research posits that grit is a strong predictor of academic outcomes for many, but not all, students. Furthermore, it seems that the predictive abilities of grit can be enhanced by concentrating on the perseverance of efforts component of grit, rather than overall grit. While the importance of grit's perseverance component has been confirmed; there are several recommendations for future research. Likewise, a number of inconsistencies are discussed relating to grits practical applications within an educational context. Cultivating grittiness, specifically perseverance of efforts, in student populations would reap huge rewards. Indeed, the educational rewards for students would be substantial, as well as the financial benefits for schools and educating institutions. The usefulness of cultivating a perseverance of efforts in students is discussed.}

  abstract = {Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, Majmaah University, Ministry of Education, Al-Majmaah City, Riyadh Region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Dear editor I thank Sharma et al for their interest in my work and putting efforts into writing an informative letter. In my study ``Effects of Grit on the Academic Performance of Medical Students A Cross-Sectional Study at Majmaah University'', it was observed that the mean grit score between students who repeated a year or more and non-repeaters had a statistical significance; however, this difference does not necessarily prove that grit score can be used for predicting whether a medical student will repeat a year or not, and no significant difference in mean grit scores was found between those who repeated 1 year only (n= 53, Mean grit score= 3.16, SD = 0.56) and those who repeated more than 1 year (n= 25, Mean grit score= 3.02) (p value= 0.87). Acknowledging the fact that academic performance depends on multiple factors, unlike other studies, my study did not make any generalized claim, it just reports a significant difference in grit between repeaters and nonrepeaters. The fact that there is no significant difference in grit scores between one-year repeaters and multi-year repeaters could reflect that grit score has a cut off value of 3, below which it loses its predictive value; however, this study makes no claim about the predictive power of grit score, a different study design is needed to make such assertion. My study also did not suggest that grit score is specific to medical students or to academic performance. Grit is a ``psychological construct'' which reflects an individual's tendency for putting persistent efforts. It can be applied to different fields and domains. As is the case with other psychological constructs, grit score of an individual can change with time; therefore, the study is indeed in agreement with the point mentioned by Sharma et al, as it was stated in the future prospective section of my study, longitudinal study design is needed to assess whether and how grit score changes along the years. Sharma et al also indicated the possible effect of differences in social support between local students and students from outside the city. Though such a point has its merit, in today's context when academic institutions are getting more and more global and diverse, I do not feel students' mobility is necessarily related to social status and will impact the academic performance adversely.

  abstract = {This article argues that the Just War tradition would do well to consider the importance of competence -- and that doing so would invigorate debates about the use of organized violence. The article defends this argument through several moves. First, inspired by Aristotle's thoughts on phronesis and chance, we view competence as a practice among those who, as a matter of course, engage in practical reasoning that takes into account the contingency of political action. Second, following from Arendt, competence can be considered that which foregrounds means over ends. Third, because competence is a continuous and more vigilant consideration of justice within war, it extends through both jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, including the ``proper authority'' and ``reasonable chance for success'' conditions of the former, and the ``double effect'' doctrine discussed in the latter. The article concludes by acknowledging the challenges presented by an overemphasis on competence, before ultimately restating its purchase for Just War debates in the twenty-first century.}

The current research attempts to investigate support for law enforcement usage of UAS, and the factors affecting this support. Methods A three-study mixed methods approach was taken. In the first study, participants responded to questions asking their level of support for police UAS usage in neighborhoods with varying racial compositions, as well as answering free response questions related to the scenario. The second and third study investigated support for police UAS usage, and whether or not this was influenced by participants' political affiliation. Results Study one indicated that participants displayed significantly more support for law enforcement's use of UAS when flying over a predominately African-American neighborhood than when flying over a primarily Caucasian neighborhood. Study two furthered these results by finding that those identifying as liberal showed less support for law enforcement UAS use, and expressed higher levels of privacy concerns than those identifying as conservative. Study three further investigated political affiliation using the Nolan Chart survey, finding that libertarians, liberals, conservatives, and authoritarians had differing levels of support and privacy concerns. Conclusions This research adds to a foundation of understanding consumer acceptance and support for law enforcement UAS usage. As this practice becomes more common, it is important to understand support, as individual perceptions will likely influence actions. This work has numerous practical applications for policy and design.},

Framing the ``new'' concepts that way helps connect our thinking to a wider range of empirical work and helps identify important unresolved issues for future research.

  abstract = {Background: Early in 2020, mental health services had to rapidly shift from face-to-face models of care to delivering the majority of treatments remotely (by video or phone call or occasionally messaging) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in several challenges for staff and patients, but also in benefits such as convenience or increased access for people with impaired mobility or in rural areas. There is a need to understand the extent and impacts of telemental health implementation, and barriers and facilitators to its effective and acceptable use. This is relevant both to future emergency adoption of telemental health and to debates on its future use in routine mental health care. Objective: To investigate the adoption and impacts of telemental health approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, and facilitators and barriers to optimal implementation. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched for primary research relating to remote working, mental health care, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprint servers were also searched. Results of studies were synthesized using framework synthesis. Results: A total of 77 papers met our inclusion criteria. In most studies, the majority of contacts could be transferred to a remote form during the pandemic, and good acceptability to service users and clinicians tended to be reported, at least where the alternative to remote contacts was interrupting care. However, a range of impediments to dealing optimal care by this means were also identified. Conclusions: Implementation of telemental health allowed some continuing support to the majority of service users during the COVID-19 pandemic and has value in an emergency situation. However, not all service users can be reached by this means, and better evidence is now needed on long-term impacts on therapeutic relationships and quality of care, and on impacts on groups at risk of digital exclusion and how to mitigate these.

Their low payload capacity and ability to overcome congested road networks enables them to provide fast delivery services for urgent high-value low-volume cargo. This work investigates the economic viability of integrating UAVs into urban hospital supply chains. In doing so, a strategic model that determines the optimal configuration of supporting infrastructure for urgent UAV delivery between hospitals is proposed. The model incorporates a tailored facility location algorithm that selects an optimal number of hubs given a set of candidates and determines the number of UAVs required to fulfill total demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementation, computed as the sum of generalized, battery, vehicle, and hub establishment costs. The model is applied to a case study based on the establishment of a UAV delivery network for deliveries between National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in London. A baseline scenario is also developed using current NHS vehicles for delivery. Results demonstrate that UAV-based delivery provides significant reductions in operational costs compared with the baseline. Furthermore, the analysis indicates the location of hubs is more significant to the solution optimality than any increase in range or payload.}

These scales were designed to quantitatively assess the extent to which a group of tasks or a job is team based. During a 2-week period, 52 male students working in 4-person teams were trained to perform a complex highly interdependent computer-simulated combat mission consisting of both individual- and team-based tasks. Our results indicated that the scales demonstrated high levels of interrater agreement. In addition, the scales differentiated between tasks that were predetermined to be individual versus team based. Finally, the results indicated that job-level ratings of team workflow were more strongly related to team performance than were aggregated task-level ratings of team-relatedness or team workflow. These results suggest that the scales presented here are an effective means of quantifying the extent to which tasks or jobs are team based. A research and practical implication of our findings is that the team task analysis scales could serve as criterion measures in the evaluation of team training interventions or predictors of team performance.}

In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well.}

Taking into account the low quality of accelerometers' data, the main objective of this article is to only use information of rate gyroscopes and a camera, as the sensor suite, in order to design an image-based visual servoing controller. Kinematics and dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicle are expressed in terms of visual information, which make it possible to design dynamic image-based visual servoing controllers without using linear velocity information obtained from accelerometers. Image features are selected through perspective image moments of a flat target plane in which no geometric information is required, and therefore, the approach can be applied in unknown environments. Two output feedback controllers that deal with uncertainties in dynamics of the system related to the motion of the target and also unknown depth information of the image are proposed using a linear observer. Stability analysis guarantees that the errors of the system remain uniformly ultimately bounded during a tracking mission and converge to 0 when the target is stationary. Simulation results are presented to validate the designed controllers.}

An imaged-based visual servoing approach is utilised to localise the quadrotor with respect to a moving target. Perspective image moments are used to define the visual features, which are projected on a rotated image plane to simplify the image dynamics. Attitude information and angular velocities are assumed to be available and the controller uses the flow of image features as the linear velocity cue. Presence of delay in processing and communication is modelled as a constant time delay in the force input of the translational dynamics, where a controller is designed for theses dynamics to compensate the delay effect. This controller is saturated in order to meet the quadrotor model constraint. A dynamic surface control approach is utilised for the rotational dynamics to track the desired attitude, defined through the position control loop. The stability properties of the complete control scheme are analysed using a theory of nonlinear cascaded systems. Simulation examples are provided in both nominal and perturbed conditions which show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.}

Previous research has proposed a framework within healthcare characterizing team characteristics into three categories: individual contributions, team processes, and organizational structures. However, it is still unclear how new emerging topics in the team literature fit within this framework. Here we provide more specific definitions of the three categories proposed and conduct a review that builds on this framework by adding topics identified from the current literature. To this end, we carried out a systematic search of the human factors literature to examine the research on team performance across various domains from the past five years centered. We then propose ideas for future research on team performance.}

Previous studies have demonstrated degraded human performance when monitoring automation and that it is possible to mitigate this monitoring performance drop by using adaptive automation. We used the Open Multi-Attribute Task Battery to manipulate two type of automation (static automation without manual take-over sessions and adaptive automation with planned take-over sessions) and four levels of reliability. Participants performed three simultaneous tasks, one of which was automated. Our results suggest that a perfectly reliable or a totally unreliable automation led to different strategies by the participants in terms of visual allocation policy. Under static automation, the time spent looking at the automated task in the 0\% reliability level increased over the duration of the experiment; however, the opposite was observed for the 100\% reliability level. Although similar, the magnitude of this pattern of results was largely diminished under adaptive automation. For static automation, the reported data also showed a direct link between trust in automation and visual scanning strategies. The more the trust increased, the less the automated task was looked at.}

The current paper examines the potential for the social influence of other parents to impact parent willingness to adopt AVs for their own teenagers. Early adopter status was found to be significantly related to willingness, while effects of sex and age were non-significant. These findings add to the literature that the perceived notion of being an early adopter of technology contributes to parent willingness to use AV for their adolescent children.

This study examined the data collected from 1450 parents (mothers and fathers) with children studying Primary Education years 4, 5 and 6 (M age = 10.53, SD = 0.90). The results showed that 42.3\% of the schoolchildren did not practice IM to school, 18.1\% practiced IM one way (they went to or from school alone), and 39.5\% practiced IM both way (they went to/from school alone). These findings underline the importance of parents\&rsquo; willingness for IM to school, and how the balance between how they perceive their children\&rsquo;s autonomy and difficulty for IM is relevant for greater IM to school.},

  abstract = {In this paper, computational linguistics is applied to define and capture Speech Acts in distributed sensemaking in a military map-exercise. The exercise was performed by teams of three participants playing the role of Company Commanders (assisted by a team of confederates) using either text-only or a combination of voice and text communications, using either basic or elaborated reporting formats. Analysis of communications was performed in terms of network structure (i.e., who spoke with whom), topics (derived, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, from all communications and from the speech of the Commanders), and speech acts reveals differences between conditions. It is proposed that the ``topics'' uncovered through the analysis is analogous with the ``frame'' in Data-Frame Model of sensemaking. In this way, it is possible to identify how frames are introduced, questioned and elaborated during communications in a team-based Command and Control exercise. Further, analyzing speech acts for different topics and under different conditions showed how different communication media or report formats can help or hinder team activity. It is proposed that such analysis could be viable for monitoring and supporting team communications, particularly during training exercises, but potentially as a route to providing automated decision and sensemaking support to teams.}

  abstract = {Structural health diagnosis and prognosis is the goal of structural health monitoring. Vibration-based structural health monitoring methodology has been extensively investigated. However, the conventional vibration--based methods find it difficult to detect damages of actual structures because of a high incompleteness in the monitoring information (the number of sensors is much fewer with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of a structure), intense uncertainties in the structural conditions and monitoring systems, and coupled effects of damage and environmental actions on modal parameters. It is a truth that the performance and conditions of a structure must be embedded in the monitoring data (vehicles, wind, etc.; acceleration, displacement, cable force, strain, images, videos, etc.). Therefore, there is a need to develop completely novel structural health diagnosis and prognosis methodology based on the various monitoring data. Machine learning provides the advanced mathematical frameworks and algorithms that can help discover and model the performance and conditions of a structure through deep mining of monitoring data. Thus, machine learning takes an opportunity to establish novel machine learning paradigm for structural health diagnosis and prognosis theory termed the machine learning paradigm for structural health monitoring. This article sheds light on principles for machine learning paradigm for structural health monitoring with some examples and reviews the existing challenges and open questions in this field.}

Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation. Several seeming counterexamples turned out not to disconfirm the hypothesis.

Controlling for gender, age, and driver confidence, analyses showed that automatic texting tendencies predicted both sending and reading texts while driving. The findings suggest that texting while driving behavior may be partially attributable to individuals doing so without awareness, control, attention, and intention regarding their own actions. The unique contribution of automaticity explained more variance than overall individual usage, and remained significant even after accounting for norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control.

This is undesirable as operators may under-utilize reliable aids when they are paired with unreliable aids. Two variables derived from Gestalt psychology's law of similarity were employed in an attempt to overcome this effect: gauge shape congruence and operator knowledge of the aids' reliability. Results indicated that altering the gauge shapes had no effect on operator performance. However, providing aid reliability information to the operator did have a positive effect on operator performance. More specifically, operators reacted to alarms more quickly and reduced their false alarm rates; however, they did not improve their hit rates. Future work should be conducted to assess more fully the role of aid reliability information and Gestalt psychology as they relate to the system-wide trust strategy.}

It affects the achievement and interest of students in a particular academic domain, e.g., girls at math or boys at language arts. Hence, it is important to assess the level of stereotype threat at school (STaS) in order to identify the vulnerability of students to its negative consequences. This study devised and validated two parallel versions of the STaS scale: girls in mathematics and boys in language arts in a nationally representative sample of Polish secondary school students (N = 1,241; 13--16 years). The results of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a complex sample approach showed one general factor. Furthermore, a multiple-group CFA confirmed metric invariance and partial scalar invariance. The variances for boys and girls were equal. This suggests that the construct of stereotype threat is similarly conceptualized by both genders despite being in different domains. Finally, the comparison of means of latent variables revealed a higher level of stereotype threat among boys in the language domain than girls in mathematics. Possible theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

Perceived disapproval from others was consistently associated with both outcomes (PF: {$\beta$} =.11 to 23, p {$\leq$} .05; FoS: {$\beta$} =.17-.21, p {$\leq$} .001) as was parents' perception of children's competence to travel safely (PF: {$\beta$} = -.24 to -.11, p {$\leq$} .05; FoS: {$\beta$} = -.16 to -.13, p {$\leq$} .01). Factors associated with FoS included having a female child ({$\beta$} = -.21 to -.13, p {$\leq$} .001), language other than English ({$\beta$} = .09 to.11, p {$\leq$} .01), and low levels of parent education ({$\beta$} = -.14 to -08, p {$\leq$} .05).Conclusion:The current study suggests that social norms, child competence, and perceptions about the benefits of CIM underpin PF. This evidence informs the development of interventions to reduce PF and promote CIM and children's physical activity.}

As an alternative, a cost-effective multifidelity metamodelling-based optimization strategy, where a metamodel of a high-fidelity aeroelastic simulation response is built by tuning a lower fidelity aeroelastic simulation response, is proposed. In order to address and validate such an approach, both linear and non-linear aeroelastic equations for an aerofoil employing different levels of complexity for expressing the aerodynamic load are used for the high- and low-fidelity models. An aeroelastic gust response evaluation problem is formulated for the flexible wing of a small unmanned air vehicle, whose characteristic size makes it particularly susceptible to gusts. Three different approaches to tune the low-fidelity model, both explicit and implicit, are investigated and compared. Good agreement between the high-fidelity model and the corrected low-fidelity one shows that the proposed approach is indeed suitable for optimization of the aeroelastic gust performance of flexible wings.}

Work has focused on the integration of cyberwarfare communication effects into a live--virtual--constructive (LVC) environment in order to better represent a network centric battlespace subject to cyber-attack, at a large force level. In addition, virtual cyber ranges have been developed. A virtual cyber range is a portable modeling and simulation framework that provides a real-time, hardware-in-the-loop capability for simulation of cyber threats to the entire net-centric infrastructure. The framework enables interoperability with LVC simulations, providing training and assessment of human-in-the-loop performance. This work builds on previous work and shows the need for a framework to support the modeling and simulation of cyber-attack and defense for training and assessment. This work does focus on cybersecurity for wireless communications, but the focus is on large network-centric systems at force level. Furthermore, there are published descriptions of research focused on the use of multi-agent systems in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and autonomous driving systems, such as Google's driverless car. While the vehicles are commercial by nature, there are many similarities to military autonomous vehicles (MAVs), in their system components and architecture as well as the cybersecurity threats that they face. While these works are related to the work presented in this paper, with their focus on synthetic environments and commercial autonomous systems, they are not closely related. The focus of this paper is on small point to point and point to multipoint wireless networks, comprised of only a few nodes, with the nodes representing MAVs and controllers. The US Army, Air Force, and Navy are continuing to increase their use of these systems, and are now focusing on cybersecurity. Due to the lagging focus on wireless networks and autonomous vehicles, there is not much published work that is related. Current unmanned systems were not built with cybersecurity considerations taken into account, and are thus vulnerable to cyber-attack. The objective of this paper is to present and describe the need for a cyber-attack and defense simulation framework to support the modeling and simulation for cybersecurity of autonomous vehicle systems used by US Armed Forces. These autonomous vehicle systems include unmanned aerial systems and unmanned ground systems. The paper describes a notional framework to support this type of modeling, as well as a detailed use case and example cyber-attack simulation system.}

  abstract = {The natural world has long been associated with health and described as a therapeutic landscape, and a growing body of research demonstrates the benefits of interacting with nature for mental and physical health. However, concern is growing that children have lost connection to the natural world and spend less time outdoors, despite the known health benefits of doing so. It is likely that healthy behaviors related to engagement with nature are mediated by beliefs about the value and safety of play in nature. While the literature abounds with qualitative examinations of children's attitudes toward outdoor play, there exist few instruments to quantitatively measure these attitudes. Informed by health behavior change theories, we describe the development and validation of the Attitudes toward Outdoor Play (ATOP) scales. As part of a community-academic partnership project called More Than a Pretty Place, the development of the ATOP scales unfolded in stages: (1) item generation based on a comprehensive literature review and consensus among the project team, (2) interviews with environmental educators, (3) initial pilot testing, (4) scale refinement, (5) administration during 2012 and 2013 to a sample of school children ages 9--13 (n~=~362) in Milwaukee, WI, USA, and (6) quantitative psychometric evaluation. Two distinct scales emerged: ATOP-benefits (alpha~=~0.79) and ATOP-fears (alpha~=~0.79). Validity analyses found that both scales correlated as expected with measures of engagement in outdoor play, parental support for outdoor play, and sedentary behaviors. The ATOP scales are reliable and valid instruments for measuring attitudes toward outdoor play that may mediate children's outdoor activity in natural settings. The ATOP scales could be useful for evaluating the effects of programming, such as environmental education programming, on improving children's attitudes toward the benefits of nature and reducing their fears, and may predict more distal outcomes including engagement in outdoor activity.},

Three levels of automation transparency were manipulated between-participants. Providing transparency regarding the reasoning underlying automated recommendations improved the accuracy of automation use, with no cost to decision time or subjective workload. Higher transparency in the form of projected decision outcome visualizations led to faster decisions, but less accurate automation use and an automation bias.

However, automated detection models currently fall short of giving an inspector an understanding of how the damage has progressed from one inspection to the next. The rate-of-change of the damage is a critical piece of information used by engineers to determine appropriate maintenance and rehabilitation actions to prevent structural failures. We propose a simple methodology for registering two bridge inspection videos or still images, collected at different stages of deterioration, so that trained model predictions may be directly measured and damage progression compared. The changes may be documented and presented to the inspector so that they may quickly evaluate key interest regions in the inspection video or image. Three approaches referred to as rigid, deformable, and hybrid image registration methods were experimentally tested and evaluated based on their ability to preserve the geometric characteristics of the referenced image. It was found in all experiments that the rigid, homography-based transformations performed the best for this application over a state-of-the-art deformable registration method, RANSAC-Flow.}

During a 5-day business simulation, we explore the consequences of the relational conflicts and conflict asymmetry experienced by team members. We use two different measures of conflict asymmetry: the traditional group conflict asymmetry measurement of Jehn (Adm Sci Q 40:256--282, 1995) and a social networks method. We find that when some team members evoke more conflict than others, this affects the evolution of team dynamics (and ultimately the performance of the team) even more than high levels of conflict altogether; however, group emotional awareness can mitigate this negative effect and improve the team performance through the appropriate use of conflict management strategies. Since group emotional awareness can be fostered and trained within teams, this is of practical value to improve the performance of cross-functional management teams.}

With new, more complex automation, like the self-driving car, humans will be required to forego direct task performance in favor of maintaining a supervisory role over automation systems. While the use of these systems generally results in greater performance than humans performing alone, humans are reluctant to adopt these superior systems due to a lack of trust. The United States Department of Defense is investigating trust in automation in order to influence the rate of adoption of automation technology. Studying trust in automation systems requires a mechanism for quantifying and measuring trust. This paper proposes a method for measuring human trust behaviors with regard to human-automation systems through response rates of compliance and reliance. Using behavioral data from a human-subjects experiment involving automated agents, we create a system dynamics model which relates trust to other system level variables. Using this trust model, engineers will be able to study trust in human-automation team scenarios in order to design automation systems with higher rates of adoption.}

Further, there is a lack of knowledge surrounding the antecedents of intragroup conflict. Here, we examined the nature of conflict profiles in sports teams and investigated narcissism as an antecedent to the conflict profiles. In a large, multi-group sample (n~=~1107 athletes from 109 teams), participants completed measures of intragroup conflict and narcissism. Team-level latent profile analysis of intragroup conflict variables indicated five distinct within-team conflict profiles which varied in patterns of relationship, task, and process conflict. Moreover, teams high in narcissism (both in terms of team mean and team maximum scores) were more likely to occupy dysfunctional conflict profiles, that is profiles high in all conflict types. These findings underscore the importance of considering conflict profiles within teams and provide the first evidence for narcissism as a contributing factor in the development of conflict profiles in groups.}

Results: Forty percent of drivers reported talking on phones at least a few times per week. The percentages were highest for males (49\%) and drivers ages 25--29 (66\%). The percentage of drivers who reported never talking on phones was higher in states with all-driver bans on handheld phone use (44\%) than in states without a ban applying to all drivers (30\%). The percentage of drivers who talk on phones and always talk hands-free was higher in states with all-driver handheld phone bans (22\%) than where such bans are not in effect (13\%). Thirteen percent of drivers reported some texting while driving, and this percentage was highest among drivers ages 18--24 (43\%). Twelve percent of drivers in states with all-driver texting bans reported texting while driving, compared with 14 percent in states with no texting ban. Among drivers ages 18--24, the percentages were 45 and 48 percent, respectively. Conclusions: Most drivers reported talking on phones while driving, even though earlier surveys have found that most people think this behavior should be banned. Fewer drivers overall reported texting, but the frequency of texting was higher among young drivers. Laws banning handheld phone use seem to discourage some drivers from talking on any type of phone and motivate some drivers to talk hands-free. Laws banning texting while driving have little effect on the reported frequency of texting while driving in any age group.},

Overall, we demonstrate the complexities of voice as a multilevel phenomenon, which depends on how often and equally team members express voice.}

At this point, it is unclear how cyber defense teams are organized and led in coordinating and working together to mount and conduct an effective cyber defense. Therefore, we do not know what makes a cyber defense team more or less effective in responding to and mitigating cyber attacks. Cyber competitions offer an approach to train and evaluate the performance of cyber defense teams; such competitions are now regularly conducted at the high school, college, professional, and military defense levels. These naturalistic exercises of teamwork for cyber defense represent an important source for understanding the way defense teams form, coordinate and organize, and to determine the factors that make teams more or less successful. For this purpose, we participated in data collection at the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC) to understand the key features of effective team processes defined by outcome measures of scored team success. We collected data from wearable social sensors to assess face-to-face interactions and using a 16-point teamwork instrument called OAT (Observational Assessment of Teamwork) to assess teamwork and leadership behaviors in cyber defense. Importantly, this being a cyber defense competition, the success of these teams is evaluated along three independent scoring dimensions: (a) Maintaining Services, (b) Incidence Response, and (c) Scenario Injects. Our results indicate that the leadership dimension and face-to-face interactions are important factors that determine the success of these teams. Teams with effective leadership were more successful, and face-to-face interactions emerged as a strong negative predictor of success. Thus, functional specialization within a team and well-guided leadership could be important predictors of timely detection and mitigation of ongoing cyber attacks. Future research should address more concrete aspects of team coordination and evaluation in cyber defense teams.},

The capability of a country (a.k.a. its national strength) is largest at its home base and declines as the nation moves away. Capable states are relatively less impeded by distance and can therefore influence more distant regions. Given armed conflict, battles are expected to occur in areas where the projected powers of the antagonists are comparable. When the aggressor's projected power is greater than the national strength of the defender, the latter side should give in without violence. This paper is a first attempt to apply Boulding's theory of international power projection to the study of civil war. Using new data on the point location of conflict onset and a variety of measures of state and rebel strength, this paper tests empirically one corollary of the LSG model: that civil wars in general locate further away from the capital in more powerful regimes.}

The purpose of this research was to present an approach that more adequately assesses the potential mediating effect of trust among systems' characteristics and human compliance and reliance by establishing temporal precedence in the measurement of trust, compliance, and reliance. Contrary to previous theory and empirical findings, the preliminary results from this approach suggest that trust does not serve as a mediating factor. These findings seem to suggest that although trust is related to human compliance and reliance, it is simply a result of systems' characteristics that may or may not have differential effects on human-automation interaction.}

Autonomous driving technology is often motivated towards removing humans from the control loop of driving but up to now, has not been able to fully realize such aims. This paper summarizes two experiments that were conducted to investigate viability aspects of emulated teledriving from the point of view of a teledriver and of telepassengers. In the first experiment, a test driver improved lateral lane conformance across a closed-course track after only a few laps while experiencing novel arrangements of live-filmed driving camera and display views. In the second experiment, acceptance ratings from online survey respondents showed prominent negative scores only after viewing simulated driving videos with up to 20x to 50x the steering angle error of a modeled tele-steering device. Together, these studies suggest plausibility for teledriving and promise for future human factors research in this area.}

Although justified and necessary, psychologists question the impact of this process of COVID-19 isolation on the mental health of the population. Hence, this paper investigated the relationship between neuroticism, boredom, fantasy engagement, perceived control over time, and the fear of COVID-19. Specifically, we performed a cross-sectional study aimed at testing an integrative moderated mediation model. Our model assigned the boredom to the mediation role and both the fantasy engagement and perceived control of time to the role of moderators in the relationship between neuroticism and the fear of COVID-19. A sample of 301 subjects, mainly women (68.8\%), aged between 18 and 57 years (Mage = 22.12 years; SD = 6.29), participated in a survey conducted in the 1st-week lockdown phase 2 in Italy from May 7 to 18, 2020. Results suggested that neuroticism is crucial in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with literature showing high neurotic people having greater emotional reactivity and scarce resources to manage stress. We also found that people with high neuroticism tend to feel bored, and the relationship between neuroticism and boredom seems enhanced if one is involved in negative fantasies. Therefore, this result could also explain the positive effect between boredom and fear of COVID-19 we found in the current study. However, our data show that perceived control over time moderates the association between boredom and fear toward COVID-19. Having a high perceived control over time allows people to reduce boredom's effect on fear of COVID-19. In conclusion, we retain that psychological treatment programs could improve the individuals' perceived control over time to modulate anxiety toward the fear of COVID-19 and promote psychological well-being.}

We therefore examined relationships between stereotype threat as a proximal contextual variable and academic self-efficacy. We also examined the influence of self-efficacy for coping with educational barriers on those relationships. A total of 211 women undergraduate students majoring in engineering fields (73\% White, mean age=21years) responded to measures of stigma consciousness and stereotype vulnerability as proxies for stereotype threat, along with measures of self-efficacy for coping with barriers (CWB) and academic self-efficacy. Stigma consciousness (in the form of awareness of sexism and negative attitudes about women), but not stereotype vulnerability, negatively related to women's confidence in their abilities to complete a college degree in a engineering major field. Results of a moderation model indicated a significant interaction of CWB and stigma consciousness on academic self-efficacy, with no such interaction effect for stereotype vulnerability. Our findings add to the proximal contextual barriers framework within Social Cognitive Career Theory by uncovering the existence of negative relationships between consciousness of discrimination due to group identity and academic self-efficacy. Promoting positive identity and constructive interaction with the environment may support women's career development in engineering fields.},

The in-house programmed compressible Navier--Stoke solver is preconditioned for low Mach number flow regime, and a dual time-stepping strategy is employed to guarantee the computing accuracy and efficiency. Momentum source items are added in the Navier--Stoke solver to replace the contra-rotating propellers in numerical simulation which simplify the inherently unsteady flow into a quasi-steady one. The developed method was verified and validated as a reliable tool for predicting the unsteady aerodynamic performance in low Reynolds flow regime. The effects of reduced frequency, flight velocity and propeller speed on the aerodynamic performance of the ducted fan micro air vehicle are evaluated in this paper. Results show that the hysteresis effect of aerodynamic coefficient increases as induced frequency, freestream velocity and propeller speed increases.}

The reported experiment used a UAV simulation environment to evaluate two applications of autonomy levels across two primary control tasks: allocation (assignment of sensor tasks to vehicles) and router (determining vehicles' flight plans). In one application, the autonomy level was the same across these two tasks. In the other, the autonomy levels differed, one of the two tasks being more automated than the other. Trials also involved completion of other mission-related secondary tasks as participants supervised three UAVs. The results showed that performance on both the primary tasks and many secondary tasks was better when the level of automation was the same across the two sequential primary tasks. These findings suggest that having the level of automation similar across closely coupled tasks reduces mode awareness problems, which can negate the intended benefits of a fine-grained application of automation. Several research issues are identified to further explore the impact of automation-level transference in supervisory control applications involving the application of automation across numerous tasks.}

Visual attention has been considered a contributing factor to traffic crashes, and fog-related accidents are prone to be more severe and involve multiple vehicles. The literature lacks studies on the influence of fog on drivers' visual performance and environment's infrastructure design. This article investigates the effects of fog on drivers' performance in a Brazilian curved road segment through a driving simulator experiment -- more precisely, whether the presence of fog (foggy scenario) or its absence (clear scenario) significantly affects the visual profile. In the foggy scenario, the results showed the tracked area was concentrated in a smaller region, despite an increase in the number of fixations compared with the clear scenario. The fixation duration did not change between the scenarios and the pupil dilation was shorter in the foggy one. The study shows the influence of environmental conditions on the driver's performance and is one of the first on the use of driving simulators with realistic representations of the road infrastructure and its surrounding for the understanding of driving under fog in the Brazilian scenario. Besides roadway geometry elements, driving simulator studies enable analyses of features related to the interaction between route environment and driver's answer, and can improve safety in places with visibility problems caused by fog, reducing their environmental impact and preserving drivers' lives.},

The analysis examined if trust increased, decreased, or stayed the same during transitions between two different LOAs. Through a thematic analysis, themes influencing the participant's trust in agents were identified. Current findings suggest trust increases most when a participant moves between moderate LOAs. Specifically, moving from the condition in which the role of the agent is to provide advice, to the agent making decisions on their own with the consent of the human. Trust was also shown to increase when the human moved from the highest LOA (human merely vetoes) to the manual condition. The most prevalent themes influencing trust included perceived agent errors and false alarms.}

We found a third of the sample, in particular around half of all primary schoolchildren, were driven home from school. Most children usually had parental accompaniment on local trips and were almost always driven. Using regression analyses we examined which of the following were associated with these behaviours: distance (to school); social trust; concern about injury while crossing a road; urban/rural location; attending primary/secondary school; sex, age of child; at least one parent not being employed full-time; household car access. In the analysis social trust and concern about injury were prominent explanatory variables. The results suggest public policy interventions that aim to improve road safety, increase community connectedness and build social trust may be important to encourage active transport for children.},

As a result, we are able to show how the appropriation and use of drones can help communities to highlight some underinvestigated social issues. The analysis underlines two different ways of using drone technology to support the local community's narrative, based on the level of involvement of the journalists in the community cause itself.}

The 10-item Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMO) is the most used instrument to measure FoMO levels and, for this reason, it seems relevant to evaluate its psychometric properties across various cultures. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the scale items using a sample of 436 college students [F\,=\,51.1\%; M (SD)\,=\,22.13 (2.78) years old]. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order to determine whether the results of Study 1 could be confirmed with another sample of college students [n\,=\,239; F\,=\,61.1\%; M (SD)\,=\,23.02(2.64) years old] and adolescents [n\,=\,178; M\,=\,57.3\%; M (SD)\,=\,16.2 (1.48) years old]. The model was also tested for measurement invariance by sex and age (collegiate versus high school students). Full scalar invariance of the FoMO across sex and age was supported and adequate internal consistency was found. Convergent validity was also demonstrated. As a result, we concluded that the FoMO might be used in clinical settings as a means of screening people who show potentially high behavioral engagement with social media. The FoMO can also help identify specific maladaptive cognitions and ruminative thoughts that maintain FoMO.},

We performed a Monte Carlo tradeoff analysis to determine the optimal combination of sensor versus algorithm capability for an airborne wide area motion imagery (WAMI) system used to identify insurgents detonating improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in urban environments. We created a computational model of the WAMI system, including the camera and algorithms for processing, exploitation, and dissemination. We also synthesized input data consisting of objects and activities taking place in a city over two days. We compared the model's output versus input to quantify its overall value to the counter-IED mission. We exercised the model twice: forensically to identify insurgents after the IED explosions and prospectively to identify insurgents as early as possible beforehand. Although better sensors led to better intermediate results, they did not always lead to greater overall value. Once the number of true positives saturated at its best possible value, the number of false positives continued to grow as the quality of the sensor improved. Similar results may occur for other scenarios in which threats are limited in number with low prevalence.}

Parametric tests were used, because the data showed a normal distribution. p {\textbackslash}textless.01 significance level criteria were taken. According to the findings, positive correlation between internal academic locus of control and positive thinking skills was found (r=.54). A positive correlation was found between the internal academic locus of control and grit at (r=.58). A positive correlation was found between positive thinking skills and grit (r=.61). The internal academic locus of control, external academic locus of control and positive thinking skills explain the 50\% of the grit's total variance. Based on this evidence, it can be said that the academic locus of control and positive thinking skills are important predictors for grit.}

Some researchers have operationally defined trust as the behavior exhibited. Other researchers have suggested that although trust may guide operator responses, trust does not completely determine the behavior.Method:Forty-four participants interacted with a primary flight simulation task and a secondary signaling system task. The signaling system varied in reliability (90\%, 60\%) and error bias (false alarm, miss prone). Trust was measured halfway through the experimental session to address the criterion of temporal precedence in determining the effect of trust on behavior.Results:Analyses indicated that trust partially mediated the relationship between reliability and agreement rate. Trust did not mediate the relationship between reliability and reaction time. Trust also did not mediate the relationships between error bias and reaction time or agreement rate. Analyses of variance generally supported specific behavioral and trust hypotheses, indicating that the paradigm employed produced similar effects on response behaviors and subjective estimates of trust observed in other studies.Conclusion:These results indicate that strong assumptions of trust acting as the prime mediator between system error characteristics and response behaviors should be viewed with caution.Application:Practitioners should consider assessing factors other than trust to determine potential operator response behaviors, which may be more predictive.}

We propose that for trust mediation to occur, the operator must be presented with a salient choice, and there must be an element of risk for dependence.Background:Research suggests that false alarms and misses affect dependence via two independent processes, hypothesized as trust in signals and trust in nonsignals. These two trust types manifest in categorically different behaviors: compliance and reliance.Method:Eighty-eight participants completed a primary flight task and a secondary signaling system task. Participants evaluated their trust according to the informational bases of trust: performance, process, and purpose. Participants were in a high- or low-risk group. Signaling systems varied by reliability (90\%, 60\%) within subjects and error bias (false alarm prone, miss prone) between subjects.Results:False-alarm rate affected compliance but not reliance. Miss rate affected reliance but not compliance. Mediation analyses indicated that trust mediated the relationship between false-alarm rate and compliance. Bayesian mediation analyses favored evidence indicating trust did not mediate miss rate and reliance. Conditional indirect effects indicated that factors of trust mediated the relationship between false-alarm rate and compliance (i.e., purpose) and reliance (i.e., process) but only in the high-risk group.Conclusion:The compliance?reliance paradigm is not the reflection of two types of trust.Application:This research could be used to update training and design recommendations that are based upon the assumption that trust causes operator responses regardless of error bias.}

In this study, we first examined the bidirectional relations between 182 adolescents' and their friends' self-reported alcohol and cannabis use frequency from ages 14 to 16. Then, we tested the moderating role of the participants' attachment-related avoidance and anxiety, measured using the Attachment Scale Questionnaire, in how these relations unfold between ages 15 and 16. Cross-lagged models with interaction analyses supported both mechanisms for both substances, but selection was stronger.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted life and all forms of education. However, the impact on medical education is unique since the need for continuity of training medical students is urgent and traditionally calls for hands-on training and a physical presence. This is further compounded by the unavailability of teachers who are also serving as frontline health-care providers in the pandemic. This article discusses the role and types of information communication technology (ICT) tools in filling the gaps and ensuring educational continuity in medical education, collaboration, and learning, across the world in the current scenario. A variety of online collaboration tools and digital interventions are discussed. A comparison between the various ICT tools being used by medical educators is also presented. The potential and corresponding challenges of revamping the medical education system and incorporating ICT tools in the long run have also been discussed. Our work can serve as the basis of further studies on creating digital educational models in medical education.}

Forty participants were trained for 3~h on a complex process control simulation modelling six levels of automation (LOA). In training, participants either experienced a high- (100\%) or low-reliability system (50\%). The impact of training experience on operator behaviour was examined during a 2.5~h testing session, in which participants either experienced a high- (100\%) or low-reliability system (60\%). The results showed that most operators did not often switch between LOA. Most chose an LOA that relieved them of most tasks but maintained their decision authority. Training experience did not have a strong impact on the outcome measures (e.g. performance, complacency). Low system reliability led to decreased performance and self-confidence. Furthermore, complacency was observed under high system reliability. Overall, the findings suggest benefits of adaptable automation because it accommodates different operator preferences for LOA.Practitioner Summary: The present research shows that operators can adapt to changes in system reliability between training and testing sessions. Furthermore, it provides evidence that each operator has his/her preferred automation level. Since this preference varies strongly between operators, adaptable automation seems to be suitable to accommodate these large differences.}

The current study investigated smartphone usage before and during COVID-19. Our study used a dataset from a smartphone app that objectively logged users' activities, including apps accessed and each app session start and end time. These were collected during two periods: pre-COVID-19 (161 individuals with 77 females) and during COVID-19 (251 individuals with 159 females). We report on the top 15 apps used in both periods. The Mann--Whitney U test was used for the inferential analysis. The results revealed that the time spent on smartphones has increased since COVID-19. During both periods, emerging adults were found to spend more time on smartphones compared to adults. The time spent on social media apps has also increased since COVID-19. Females were found to spend more time on social media than males. Females were also found to be more likely to launch social media apps than males. There has also been an increase in the number of people who use gaming apps since the pandemic. The use of objectively collected data is a methodological strength of our study. Additionally, we draw parallels with the usage of smartphones in contexts similar to the COVID-19 period, especially concerning the limitations on social gatherings, including working from home for extended periods.

The studies investigate the impact of various design variables on optimized tandem airfoil. The results show that tandem airfoil in lower Reynolds flow has better aerodynamic performance at high angle of attack. And the lift-to-drag ratio can be further increased by 11.9\% when airfoil profile variables are introduced. Morphing tandem airfoil can overcome low lift-to-drag ratio at lower lift coefficient, and is attractive for unmanned aircraft.}

Results showed that RoboLeader (Fully Automated condition) was more effective in encapsulating the moving targets than were the human operators (when they were either without assistance from RoboLeader or when they were partially assisted by RoboLeader). Participants successfully encapsulated the moving targets only 63\% of the time in the Manual condition but 89\% of the time when they were assisted by RoboLeader. Those participants who play video games frequently demonstrated significantly better encapsulation performance than did infrequent gamers; they also had better situation awareness of the mission environment.

Although many studies have examined the properties of GFI as indicators of overall model fit for single-group data, there have been none to date that examine how GFIs change when between-group constraints are added to a measurement model. The lack of a consensus about what constitutes significant GFI differences places limits on measurement invariance testing. We examine 20 GFIs based on the minimum fit function. A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs ({$\Delta$}GFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using {$\Delta$}comparative fit index, {$\Delta$}Gamma hat, and {$\Delta$}McDonald's Noncentrality Index to evaluate measurement invariance. These three {$\Delta$}GFIs are independent of both model complexity and sample size, and are not correlated with the overall fit measures. We propose critical values of these {$\Delta$}GFIs that indicate measurement invariance.}

  abstract = {Human multi-robot interaction exploits both the human operator's high-level decision-making skills and the robotic agents' vigorous computing and motion abilities. While controlling multi-robot teams, an operator's attention must constantly shift between individual robots to maintain sufficient situation awareness. To conserve an operator's attentional resources, a robot with self-reflect capability on its abnormal status can help an operator focus her attention on emergent tasks rather than unneeded routine checks. With the proposing self-reflect aids, the human-robot interaction becomes a queuing framework, where the robots act as the clients to request for interaction and an operator acts as the server to respond these job requests. This paper examined two types of queuing schemes, the self-paced Open-queue identifying all robots' normal/abnormal conditions, whereas the forced-paced shortest-job-first (SJF) queue showing a single robot's request at one time by following the SJF approach. As a robot may miscarry its experienced failures in various situations, the effects of imperfect automation were also investigated in this paper. The results suggest that the SJF attentional scheduling approach can provide stable performance in both primary (locate potential targets) and secondary (resolve robots' failures) tasks, regardless of the system's reliability levels. However, the conventional results (e.g., number of targets marked) only present little information about users' underlying cognitive strategies and may fail to reflect the user's true intent. As understanding users' intentions is critical to providing appropriate cognitive aids to enhance task performance, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to examine operators' underlying cognitive intent and identify the unobservable cognitive states. The HMM results demonstrate fundamental differences among the queuing mechanisms and reliability conditions. The findings suggest that HMM can be helpful in investigating the use of human cognitive resources under multitasking environments.},

During and to some extent post-summer 2018, we find significant increases in participants failing response validity indicators, decreases in reliability and validity of a widely used personality measure, and failures to replicate well-established findings.

Data were analysed for 181 children aged 8--15 years. Results The strongest significant sibling effect for independently mobility to school, local shop and {$\geq$}3 destinations was for having an older sibling of the same gender (p{$\leq$}0.05). For independent mobility to a friend's house and park, the strongest significant sibling effect was for having one older sibling (p{$\leq$}0.05). Dog ownership was associated with increased odds of being independently mobile to {$\geq$}3 destinations (OR=2.43; 95\%CI=1.03--5.74). Conclusions Parents may be more likely to grant children licence to travel to local places if they are accompanied by an older sibling or the family dog.

The increasing level of vehicle automation is likely to further increase phone use behind the wheel, as the automation takes over part of the driving task drivers are likely to experience boredom and feel more confident to get involved in other activities such as phone use. This may further increase the distraction related accidents on our roads. However, the extent to which this further increases depends largely on the drivers' level of self-regulation of risk, the timing of engagement in phone activities in relation to the driving context. The objective of this study was to investigate if drivers self-regulate their mobile phone use, specifically focussed on the visual manual (VM) task which is associated with the largest increase in risk, while driving in relation to different driving contexts. For this study naturalistic driving data was analysed of Dutch car drivers collected in the UDRIVE project. The results show that Dutch drivers spent over 9\% of all driving time engaging in mobile phone related tasks, including calling and VM tasks such as texting. Drivers used their mobile phone significantly less when a passenger was present. Also, significantly more VM tasks were initiated during standstill than for the other speed categories. In addition, on rural roads relatively less time was spent on VM tasks and on highways relatively more time was spent on VM tasks. Overall the results show that the driving context seems to influence the initiation and involvement in VM tasks, which is an indication that drivers self-regulate this behaviour.},

  abstract = {Grit is a non-cognitive factor that has received increased attention lately, since research indicates that it plays a significant role in successful outcomes in many fields, and more specifically in education. Grit is rooted in two facets, perseverance of effort and consistency of interest, captured by the Grit Scale. The current systematic review aimed at investigating the association of grit with positive educational outcomes, by exploring both antecedents and outcomes of grit. We identified 29 studies assessing grit in an educational context, published between 2012 and 2017. The primary findings demonstrated that grit shows weak to moderate correlations with educational variables. Its two facets play different roles, with perseverance being a stronger positive predictor of academic performance. Finally, positive variables, such as hope, positive affect and family relationships can foster grit. However, a deeper understanding of the grit construct is essential to distinguish it from facets of the conscientiousness dimension of personality. The usefulness of findings for policy makers and education professionals is discussed, as well as the importance of reinforcing grit in the educational community in order to nurture character in students and enhance their potential.}

The paper describes the approach adopted to model the extant maintenance processes (focusing on role mapping) and associated organisational structures which revealed issues such as unclear processes, poor communication and data sharing links and problems with delineation of responsibility for decision making. It also describes the development of a new maintenance process model that incorporates the additional functionality of the new prognostic tool, taking in to account changes of roles, responsibilities, organisational processes and activities.}

In addition to team knowledge, team performance and team process behaviors are also measured. Knowledge measures are compared and evaluated in terms of their ability to predict team performance and reflect skill acquisition. Measures of teamwork knowledge and the team situation model succeeded in reflecting knowledge changes with task acquisition. A taskwork relatedness ratings measure, taken at both the individual and team levels, along with the team situation model measure, were predictive of team performance. Specifically, high performing teams had more accurate situation models and more knowledge of the task from the perspective of other team members, as opposed to lower performing teams. Measures of knowledge at the team level provide information on the team cognition underlying team behavior and performance and have implications for the design of training programs and sociotechnical systems.}

Parental fear is a recognized barrier to children's independent mobility, however there are scant reliable tools to measure this fear. We report on the development and validation of two brief scales to assess parental fear, `Parental Fear' (PF) and `Fear of Strangers' (FoS). Specifically, we aimed to: confirm the construct validity of the scales; establish discriminant validity between PF, FoS and parents' mental health (as measured on the Kessler-6); assess the internal consistency and test--retest reliability of PF and FoS; and establish predictive validity with children's independent mobility. Development was conducted in five steps: (1) item pool generation; (2) a development study; (3) a validation study in a statewide sample (Victoria, Australia) of parents of children (9--15 years, n\,=\,1973); (4) a reliability assessment; and (5) an examination of predictive validity with respect to children's independent mobility. Two brief, robust, and internally consistent measures were established (PF, four-items; FoS, five-items), which discriminated from parent's mental health. Both measures had strong internal consistency and temporal stability. Predictive validity was established; parents who reported higher PF and FoS were less likely to allow their children to engage in a range of independent activities without an adult. These scales contribute novel valid tools for use in public health and intervention research aimed at reducing parental fear as a barrier to children's independent mobility and resultant physical activity.}

Although the literature is rife with issues concerning teams, there is no coherent structure to guide researchers wishing to gain a deeper understanding into those factors leading to positive team outcomes. Question. This is due in part to two factors; one being the methods (e.g., observation; self report) typically employed to study teams often do not apply rigorous standards for reliability and validity. The second is it is difficult to construct data gathering situations that realistically approach the context in which teams operate. Approach. Addressing the first issue, we present a framework for the type of data that should be gathered to reliably and validly evaluate team performance. We believe the second issue is best addressed through the application of serious games, where realistic scenarios are delivered representing problems similar to those faced by teams in the real world. Finally, we describe a study whereby we demonstrate the approach utilizing a serious game to gather the data, which is then analyzed to assess the reliability and validity of the measures. Conclusion. With reliability and validity being established, a latent change score model is presented to illustrate how rich models of team interaction can be stated, investigated, and statistically assessed; since the serious game ensures the quality of the team interaction and the superior quality of the data.}

Conclusions Grit and a total number of absences are significant contributors to academic success, particularly among Hispanic adolescents.

Often, these drones are very lightweight and are flown in backyards, sport fields, parking lots, and such places. They typically pose no lethal threat to people in the vicinity of the drone. Nonetheless, in many countries such drones are regulated by aviation rules that does not (sufficiently well) distinguish between these drones and the larger hobby or professional drones. Consequently such small drones are flown illegally. This has prompted some national aviation authorities to consider a form of ``harmless'' category, which ideally should be based on a mass threshold. To aid such a classification this work proposes a mass threshold of 250 g, below which, we argue, it is reasonable to classify drones as ``harmless'' in the sense that the expected fatality rate is equivalent to that of manned aviation. In this work we combine a series of models and methods to provide a foundation for giving a mass threshold. The approach is probabilistic and focuses on the relation between mass and human injury in the case of small drones. The approach is also parameterized such that readers can substitute other probabilities and conduct their own calculations, possibly determining a different mass threshold.}

This paper presents an inverse system method (ISM) to achieve precise motion control for the LEMA spoiler system, which is based on a voice coil motor. The dynamic model of the LEMA spoiler system is established, and the inverse system of the LEMA spoiler is obtained. By linearization of the nonlinear LEMA spoiler system, the state feedback control is used to control the spoiler to follow the desired spoiler motion. A state variable observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable state variables. Simulations and experimental setup are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The performance of proportional-integral-differential (PID) control is compared to the ISM control in simulation and ISM control is robust to large parameter variations of 50\%. The experimental results show close agreement with the simulation results. The proposed method proved effective by achieving a transient time of 5.5 ms and system bandwidth of 20 Hz, so that ISM control method can more effectively handle the parameters' perturbation, load disturbance, the variation of work temperature, and the LEMA's nonlinearity.}

  abstract = {A common assumption across many industries is that inserting advanced autonomy can often replace humans for low-level tasks, with cost reduction benefits. However, humans are often only partially replaced and moved into a supervisory capacity with reduced training. It is not clear how this shift from human to automation control and subsequent training reduction influences human performance, errors, and a tendency toward automation bias. To this end, a study was conducted to determine whether adding autonomy and skipping skill-based training could influence performance in a supervisory control task. In the human-in-the-loop experiment, operators performed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search tasks with varying degrees of autonomy and training. At the lowest level of autonomy, operators searched images and, at the highest level, an automated target recognition algorithm presented its best estimate of a possible target, occasionally incorrectly. Results were mixed, with search time not affected by skill-based training. However, novices with skill-based training and automated target search misclassified more targets, suggesting a propensity toward automation bias. More experienced operators had significantly fewer misclassifications when the autonomy erred. A descriptive machine learning model in the form of a hidden Markov model also provided new insights for improved training protocols and interventional technologies.}

  abstract = {Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automation's suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automation's requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems.},

  abstract = {A resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system is a necessity for the robust navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides satellite-based PNT services. However, a spoofer can tamper the authentic GNSS signal and could transmit wrong position information to an AV. Therefore, an AV must have the capability of real-time detection of spoofing attacks related to PNT receivers, whereby it will help the end-user (the AV in this case) to navigate safely even if the GNSS is compromised. This paper aims to develop a deep reinforcement learning (RL)-based turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection method using low-cost in-vehicle sensor data. We have utilized the Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset to create attack and non-attack datasets to develop a deep RL model and have evaluated the performance of the deep RL-based attack detection model. We find that the accuracy of the deep RL model ranges from 99.99\% to 100\%, and the recall value is 100\%. Furthermore, the precision ranges from 93.44\% to 100\%, and the f1 score ranges from 96.61\% to 100\%. Overall, the analyses reveal that the RL model is effective in turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection.}

Most routing protocols designed for MANETs assume connected networks. Such a restriction directly limits the application domains of MANETs. In this paper, we study the problem of providing time-critical data delivery in sparse ad hoc networks where network partition can last for a long period, without imposing any restrictions on the node mobility. Supporting real-time communication with unconstrained mobility is important to many mission-critical applications such as battlefields and search and rescue in large-scale disaster areas. In this paper, we propose microrouting networks consisting of tiny nodes similar to sensors but without transducers (called microrouters) as a substrate for time-critical data delivery in sparse MANETs. We describe the microrouting protocol for the resulting hybrid network which exploits the fact that microrouters are stationary, but are constrained by energy and memory. Key features of the microrouting protocol design include stateless architecture and localized route repair. We demonstrate the viability of the microrouting network architecture via detailed simulation evaluation. Our results show that microrouting networks running the microrouting protocol efficiently extend the connectivity of sparse MANETs and provide high packet delivery ratios.}

However, there is limited research on how grit's dimensions relate to pro-environmental outcomes. This study aims to explore the associations of grit's dimensions (i.e., perseverance of effort and consistency of interests) with environmental passion, environmentally friendly behaviors, and environmental awareness via a cross-sectional design. Method A sample of 700 Filipino undergraduate students completed a self-reported survey on grit, environmental awareness, environmental passion, and pro-environmental behaviors. Structural equation modeling via maximum likelihood estimation was used to examine the hypothesized links among grit and pro-environmental outcomes. Results Both dimensions of grit were associated with all pro-environmental outcomes. Whereas consistency was more strongly linked to environmental passion, perseverance was more strongly related to environmentally friendly behaviors as well as environmental awareness. Conclusions Results point to the ecological benefits of espousing passion and perseverance for long-term goals. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: (1) Prior research shows that grit predicts academic success and well-being outcomes. (2) Studies also demonstrated that perseverance had more robust associations with optimal performance and psychological outcomes. (3) There is evidence showing how grit relates to self-regulation. What this topic adds: (1) This study demonstrated that both perseverance of effort and consistency of interests positively predicted environmental passion, environmentally friendly behaviors, and environmental awareness. (2) Whereas consistency appears to be more strongly linked to environmental passion, perseverance was more strongly related to environmentally friendly behaviors as well as environmental awareness. (3) These findings offered preliminary evidence regarding the ecological benefits of grit.}

The current study addressed this research gap through examining the association of everyday discrimination with negative emotions and academic achievement among Filipino high school students. A cross-sectional study (Study 1) showed that everyday discrimination was positively associated with negative emotions and negatively linked to perceived academic achievement. Furthermore, everyday discrimination had indirect effects on academic achievement through the intermediate variable negative emotions. Then, a two-wave cross-lagged panel investigation (Study 2) demonstrated that Time 1 everyday discrimination was linked to higher Time 2 negative emotions. Reciprocal associations were also found among the constructs because Time 1 academic achievement was linked to lower levels Time 2 negative emotions and Time 2 everyday discrimination. The theoretical and practical implications of the research are elucidated.},

It was predicted that MP automation would increase trust, LAT would increase trust, FP automation would increase reliance, and MP automation would increase compliance whereas LAT would decrease compliance when used with a FP system. Results indicated that trust was higher with the FP system, reliance was higher with the FP system, and compliance was higher with the MP system. This paper further informs the relationships among trust, reliance, and compliance, and it adds to our understanding of operator behavior in miss-prone tasks. Practical applications of this research include improving automation design and choosing the appropriate type of automation to implement for specific situations.}

  abstract = {System evaluation and testing of unmanned underwater vehicles in their destined environment can be tedious, error prone, time consuming, and consequently expensive. However, pre-real-world testing facilities, such as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, are not always available. This is due to the time and expense required to create a specific test environment for the vehicle. Thus the system is not as fault tolerant as it could be since problems can remain undetected until the real-world testing phase. Debugging and fixing errors in the real-world testing phase are much more time consuming and expensive owing to the nature of the harsh underwater environment. This paper introduces a novel framework, the augmented-reality framework (ARF), for the rapid construction of virtual-environment testing scenarios for testing remote platforms with embedded systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The ARF provides testing facilities across all stages of the reality continuum, providing capabilities for pure simulation, HIL, hybrid simulation, and real-world testing. The framework architecture is both very generic and flexible and allows mixing of real and simulated components. The ARF is supported by a distributed communications protocol which provides location transparency of systems since this is key to providing mixed-reality testing facilities.}

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.}

In part to reduce motor-vehicle related crashes, transportation researchers are pursuing the implementation of automated vehicles. Vehicle automation will eventually remove human control from the vehicle, but this may also remove interpersonal communication between pedestrians and human drivers. Therefore, many studies have investigated pedestrians' choice of features on autonomous vehicles (AVs) to facilitate communication of vehicle intention. The inclusion of child populations in these studies has been rare, however. This study investigated pedestrians' understandability of the external features on autonomous vehicles, considering different vehicle sizes and physics (speed and distance), and included both children and adults. The results revealed that children relied entirely on the communicating features of AVs to make their judgement on their safety, thereby adopted a higher risk strategy than their adult counterparts.},

Few studies have examined the functioning of the team and the interaction between individuals in a cyber defense context and how the context influences team adaptation. The present study investigates team cognition in a cyber defense context and in particular the nature of task- or team-centered communication among analysts during a cyber defense simulation exercise. Results indicate that markers of situation assessment and shared mental models are both strategically present and linked. Nevertheless, the frequency of these markers varies depending on the quantity and quality of problems encountered; in particular, variations in social support behaviors are observed. Decreasing social support behaviors during high level activities suggests the adaptation of social behaviors depending on the threats and attacks on the system. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of theories and potential consequences for strategic adaptation and team resilience.}

The SOC staff works closely with incident response teams, security analysts, network engineers and organization managers using sophisticated data processing technologies such as security analytics, threat intelligence, and asset criticality to ensure security issues are detected, analyzed and finally addressed quickly. Those techniques are part of a reactive security strategy because they rely on the human factor, experience and the judgment of security experts, using supplementary technology to evaluate the risk impact and minimize the attack surface. This study suggests an active security strategy that adopts a vigorous method including ingenuity, data analysis, processing and decision-making support to face various cyber hazards. Specifically, the paper introduces a novel intelligence driven cognitive computing SOC that is based exclusively on progressive fully automatic procedures. The proposed \&lambda;-Architecture Network Flow Forensics Framework (\&lambda;-\&Nu;F3) is an efficient cybersecurity defense framework against adversarial attacks. It implements the Lambda machine learning architecture that can analyze a mixture of batch and streaming data, using two accurate novel computational intelligence algorithms. Specifically, it uses an Extreme Learning Machine neural network with Gaussian Radial Basis Function kernel (ELM/GRBFk) for the batch data analysis and a Self-Adjusting Memory k-Nearest Neighbors classifier (SAM/k-NN) to examine patterns from real-time streams. It is a forensics tool for big data that can enhance the automate defense strategies of SOCs to effectively respond to the threats their environments face.}

In this study, we looked at the role that team interaction (i.e., more specifically team verbal behaviors) played in TSA and team performance in order to better understand Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). We first analyzed team verbal behaviors (i.e., pushing and pulling information) across conditions of human-autonomy teams and human-human teams, and then analyzed their relationship with TSA and team performance via Growth Curve Modelling (GCM). Good teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates and that means pushing information before it is requested. Therefore, if things are going well, there should be little need for pulling information. In this study's task, participants were instructed to push information to others, and over time master the specific timing of information sharing to the intended recipient. Findings indicate that pushing information was positively associated with TSA and team performance, and human-autonomy teams had lower levels of both pushing and pulling information than all-human teams. Through this study, we have learned that anticipation of other team member behaviors and information requirements in human-autonomy teams are important for effective TSA and team performance. In order to make HAT more effective in terms of teamwork, we need to develop mechanisms to enhance pushing information within HAT.},

Of particular relevance is understanding how automation transparency, i.e., explaining the capabilities and limitations of automation to the human in real-time, can improve human-automation performance across automated systems that vary in reliability. Two hundred seventy one Naval Aviation trainees completed a simulated multi-UAV supervisory control mission for 42 minutes with three automated systems that varied in reliability. Participants were never explicitly told the reliability varied, but halfway through the mission, they were alerted that the least reliable system may falter. Results indicated human-automation performance improved after the alert for this specific system, but not as a whole, as one system's human-automation performance deteriorated. This work suggests uncertainty communication should not only include the specific, real-time capabilities of the automation, but also communicate unintentional consequences it may have on the whole environment.}

Results from 515 teams (2,658 individuals) completing a high-fidelity team-based business simulation supported the effects of aggregate levels of self-awareness on team-level functioning and performance. Moreover, these effects were influential above and beyond individual contributions themselves, highlighting the unique value of team members? self-awareness for understanding team functioning. Of the three functional outcomes, only team conflict mediated the effects of self-awareness in teams on subsequent team-level performance. Finally, results revealed that overrating among team members was a particularly problematic form of the lack of self-awareness in teams.}

The goal of the study was to highlight the qualitatively different effects of automation false alarms and misses as they relate to operator compliance and reliance, respectively. Background: Background data suggest that automation false alarms cause reduced compliance, whereas misses cause reduced reliance. Method: In two studies, 32 and 24 participants, including some licensed pilots, performed in-lab UAV simulations that presented the visual world and collected dependent measures. Results: Results indicated that with the low-reliability aids, false alarms correlated with poorer performance in the system failure task, whereas misses correlated with poorer performance in the concurrent tasks. Conclusion: Compliance and reliance do appear to be affected by false alarms and misses, respectively, and are relatively independent of each other. Application: Practical implications are that automated aids must be fairly reliable to provide global benefits and that false alarms and misses have qualitatively different effects on performance.},

Pilots were required to: a) navigate the UAV through a series of mission legs, b) search for possible targets of opportunity, and c) monitor system health. They performed the missions under three types of auditory auto-alert aids (a 100\% reliable system, a 67\% reliable system with automation false alarms, and a 67\% reliable system with automation misses), as well as a non-automated baseline condition. Results indicate that while reliable automation can benefit performance relative to baseline in the automated task, the unreliable automation aids reduced performance to that of baseline or worse. The automation false alarms and misses harmed performance in qualitatively different ways, with false alarm prone automation appearing to cause more damage than miss prone automation to both the automated task and the concurrent target search task.}

Results suggested that the scores on all three scales were structurally sound and internally consistent. However, grit and engagement explained considerably less of GPA's variance in this urban sample than academic self-concept. Therefore, this study's findings indicate that school improvement and intervention programs might be more effective if they are focused on increasing more established psychosocial factors like academic self-concept rather than grit.}

After establishing the reliability and structural validity of scores for the three constructs in this sample, regression analyses indicated that hope and academic selfefficacy were predictors of perceived ability and that academic selfefficacy was the most robust predictor of academic achievement. Grit was not a meaningful predictor of either perceived ability or academic achievement. We concluded that psychosocial variables can contribute to performance in talented students, but research is needed to establish which psychosocial variables are the most useful.}

We use data from two studies of financial hardship to examine how the fetishised ideal of resilience is reified and negotiated in the everyday experiences of low-income citizens. We argue that resilience is practised as `a way of being', but in contorted ways that reflect restrictions to agency, resources and autonomy. This article makes an original contribution by exposing a current paradox within resilience as a governing agenda: it is principally pursued in ways that compromise the material and ontological security necessary for its productive potential. The article concludes by reflecting on what conceptual and applied agendas this presents for policymakers, practitioners and academics in the UK and further afield.}

Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world's most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods. We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results. We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion. While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable.}

In a two-part study, 199 undergraduates responded to questionnaires online, and various IER indices were calculated. The IRV index identifies different respondents than other IER indices. Values on the IRV index (as well as other IER indices) are related to scores on theoretically meaningful individual differences in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and boredom proneness. This study provides researchers with a robust, easily calculated, and flexible means for screening questionnaire data for IER behavior. Practical recommendations for finding and making decisions about IER behavior patterns are provided. This study introduces the IRV index, an extension of the long string, used to identify survey research participants who likely engaged in one type of IER behavior. It is also one of the first studies to evaluate the extent to which IER indices identify different respondents as having engaged in IER and provides additional evidence that values on these indices are related to individual differences.}

Background To facilitate appropriate trust in and dependence on automation, explicitly conveying the likelihood of automation success has been proposed as one solution. Empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the potential benefits of disclosing likelihood information in the form of automation reliability, (un)certainty, and confidence. Yet, results from these studies are rather mixed. Method We conducted a human-in-the-loop experiment with 60 participants using a simulated surveillance task. Each participant performed a compensatory tracking task and a threat detection task with the help of an imperfect automated threat detector. Three types of likelihood information were presented: overall likelihood information, predictive values, and hit and correct rejection rates. Participants' trust in automation, compliance and reliance behaviors, and task performance were measured. Results Human operators informed of the predictive values or the overall likelihood value, rather than the hit and correct rejection rates, relied on the decision aid more appropriately and obtained higher task scores. Conclusion Not all likelihood information is equal in aiding human-automation team performance. Directly presenting the hit and correct rejection rates of an automated decision aid should be avoided. Application The findings can be applied to the design of automated decision aids.},

Our analysis employs a unique new global dataset with granular data on every LACM national militaries have deployed. We use this dataset to evaluate the proliferation of LACMs across the international system from 1991--2015. Using a selection model that first controls for the horizontal proliferation of LACMs, we find that insecurity, scientific and technical expertise from related technologies, the possession of highly authoritarian and highly democratic regimes, and MTCR membership all have positive effects on the sophistication of LACM-possessors' arsenals.}

As AI reliability increases, task performance improves, largely due to higher rates of compliance (following action recommendations) and reliance (following no-action recommendations).MethodsIn a between-subject design, participants were assigned to a high reliability AI, low reliability AI, or a control condition. Participants decided whether to bet that their team would win in a series of basketball games tying compensation to performance. We evaluated task performance (in accuracy and signal detection terms) and the behavioral consequences of trust (via compliance and reliance).ResultsAI recommendations improved task performance, had limited impact on risk-taking behavior, and were under-valued by participants. Accuracy, sensitivity (d?), and reliance increased in the high reliability AI condition, but there was no effect on response bias (c) or compliance. Participant behavior was only consistent with a probability matching model for compliance in the low reliability condition.ConclusionIn a pay-off structure that incentivized risk-taking, the primary value of the AI recommendations was in determining when to perform no action (i.e., pass on bets).ApplicationIn risky contexts, designers need to consider whether action or no-action recommendations will be more influential to design appropriate interventions.}

In recent times, the focus has shifted to understanding the impact or the influence of non-conventional factors such as Grit and Flow on the performance of students. In the current study, We have identified the relationship between the Grit and the get into a state of flow. The sample for this study consisted of 301 college students pursuing their education in hotel management from colleges in and around Bengaluru City. The data was collected through a questionnaire which was circulated through e-mail and social media of students. The scale used to measure Grit was the 10-item Grit Scale by Angela Duckworth and the 14 Items scale by Kazuki Yoshida was used to measure Flow. Statistical methods such as correlation, regression, t-test and ANOVA were applied in this study. Findings of the study indicate that the grit of hospitality students plays a role in their ability to enter into a state of flow.It is more likely for grittier individuals to experience flow. The levels of grit do not vary in terms of Gender, but it does with respect to year of education. The Flow levels vary between men and women, but it does not differ with year of education.}

This reliability threshold is based on tasks humans are capable of performing unaided. However, future robotic teammates may be capable of acting and gathering information and helping build situation awareness in environments that are too difficult or too dangerous for humans. However, if initial reliability is low, there may be resistance to introducing the technology. The current study investigates the perception of reliable and unreliable diagnostic aiding automation (robots) in both benign and dangerous environments. Undergraduate participants read a description of an autonomous robotic teammate working in either benign or dangerous environments, sending diagnostic aiding information to a human teammate with either high (80\%) or low (50\%) reliability. Participants in the dangerous environment conditions reported more positive overall perception of, and a stronger willingness to work with a robot, even at very low (50\%) reliability. Results suggest that in dangerous environmental conditions, people may perceive unreliable robots more positively and be more willing to work with them. Implications for the introduction of new diagnostic aiding technologies, as well as strategies to support SA under conditions of unreliable diagnostic aiding are discussed.}

  abstract = {Automation can be unreliable. This makes appropriate trust and reliance difficult to calibrate. One solution to building appropriate trust is to increase automation transparency by displaying information to the operator about the technology's underlying analytical principles. However, displaying this additional information may increase operator workload. The research and development community must balance the competing demands of providing adequate transparency and keeping operator workload low. To investigate the complex effects of transparency on workload, a modeling approach can be used by computing a measure of processing efficiency called the capacity coefficient. We conducted a study to examine the impact of increasing transparency on operator workload using the capacity coefficient. We present the data from one participant with the goal of demonstrating the utility of the capacity coefficient. We discuss how this participant's data highlights the inferences possible from capacity analysis for measuring the impact of display design and increased transparency on operator workload.}

Smart farming in Africa was hindered by development of ICT systems around the region. Recent initiatives such as Last Mile Project and other projects that connect sub-Saharan Africa to the world Internet have sparked researchers and other stakeholders in agriculture to make a move on digital agriculture and smart farming in general. These efforts will go so high when Internet costs goes down and becomes accessible to most of the farmers. Farmers in Africa are willing to adopt any technology that would simplify their daily economic activities. That is why mobile money using phones is so popular in Africa and very useful among farming communities.},

These crashes teach us that using drones for conservation is a contingent practice ensnaring humans, technologies, and animals. This article advances a crash theory in which pilots, conservation drones, and endangered megafauna are relata, or related actants, that intra-act, cocreating each other and a mutually constituted phenomena. These phenomena are entangled, with either reciprocal dependencies or erosive entrapments. The crashing of conservation drones and endangered species requires an ethics of care, repair, or reworlding. Diffractions, disruptions that expose difference, result from crashes and reveal the precarious manner by which technologies, laws, and discourses bring nature and culture together. To support crash theory, this article presents three ethnographic cases. A drone crash in the United Kingdom near white rhinoceroses while building machine learning training data exhibits the involvement of the electromagnetic spectrum; the threat of crashes in the Pacific Northwest near Puget Sound orcas discloses the impacts of drone laws; and drone crashes in Sri Lanka among Asian elephants presents the problems of technoliberal ideals around programming natural worlds. Throughout the article, a methodology is developed, parallelism, which attends to the material similarities in lateral phenomena.}

To investigate these issues further, we examined grit, its dimensions (perseverance of effort and consistency of interest), and other motivational factors---academic buoyancy and future time perspective---to test whether they were distinct constructs, and whether they were predictors of academic achievement, incorporating individual differences in gender, ethnicity, and major. The current study revealed that grit positively predicted undergraduates' GPA (N = 328, Mage = 20.88, SDage = 1.70) over and beyond demographic and other motivational variables. Regarding individual differences, men and women differed on subscales of future time perspective, and Asian Americans reported lower grit compared to White and Hispanic students, despite higher GPA compared to Hispanics.

Background Research rarely attempts to assess performance, trust, and visual attention in near-perfect automated systems even though they will be relied on in high-stakes environments. Methods Seventy-three participants completed a 40-min supervisory control task where they monitored three search feeds. All search feeds were 100\% reliable with the exception of two automation failures: one miss and one false alarm. Eye-tracking and subjective trust data were collected. Results Thirty-four percent of participants correctly identified the automation miss, and 67\% correctly identified the automation false alarm. Subjective trust increased when participants did not detect the automation failures and decreased when they did. Participants who detected the false alarm had a more complex scan pattern in the 2 min centered around the automation failure compared with those who did not. Additionally, those who detected the failures had longer dwell times in and transitioned to the center sensor feed significantly more often. Conclusion Not only does this work highlight the limitations of the human when monitoring near-perfect automated systems, it begins to quantify the subjective experience and attentional cost of the human. It further emphasizes the need to (1) reevaluate the role of the operator in future high-stakes environments and (2) understand the human on an individual level and actively design for the given individual when working with near-perfect automated systems. Application Multiple operator-level measures should be collected in real-time in order to monitor an operator's state and leverage real-time, individualized assistance.},

The current study examined the effects of the law on teenage drivers' cell phone use. Teenage drivers were observed at high schools in North Carolina 1--2 months before and approximately 5 months after the law took effect. The proportion of teenagers using cell phones did not change significantly (11.0\% before the law took effect, 11.8\% after). Cell phone use among teenage drivers at high schools in South Carolina, an adjacent state without a teenage driver phone ban, was stable at about 13\%. Interviews were conducted with parents and teenagers in North Carolina both before and after the law took effect. In post-law interviews, teenagers were more likely than parents to say they knew about the cell phone restriction (64\% vs. 39\%), but support for the ban was greater among parents (95\% vs. 74\%). Only 22\% of teenagers and 13\% of parents believed the law was being enforced fairly often or a lot. Although the proportion of teenagers who reported using phones while driving declined somewhat following the law, about half admitted they used their phones, if they had driven, on the day prior to the interview. Overall, the findings suggest that North Carolina's cell phone restriction had little to no effect on teenage drivers' use of cell phones shortly after the law took effect.},

Gender stratified logistic regression models tested these associations for 10--12 year-olds and their parents (n=1231) in Perth, Australia. For girls, parental fear of strangers was associated with lower odds of independent mobility (OR=0.71, p=0.002), and informal social control and other social and built environment variables had little attenuating influence.

Strategies that reduce residents' perceived crime risk may contribute to improved health outcomes; however interventions require a better understanding of the neighbourhood influences on residents perceptions of crime and safety. We examined the impact of changes in the objective built environment following relocation on changes in residents' perceived crime risk for participants in a longitudinal study of people moving to new neighbourhoods in Perth, Western Australia (n~=~1159). They completed a questionnaire before moving to their new neighbourhood, and again 36 months after relocation. Individual-level objective environmental measures were generated at both time points using Geographic Information Systems, focussing on the characteristics that comprise a `walkable neighbourhood'. Linear regression models examined the influence of objective environmental changes between the two environments on perceived crime risk, with progressive adjustment for other change variables (i.e., perceptions of the physical and social environment, reported crime). We found that increases in the proportion of land allocated to shopping/retail land-uses increased residents' perceived crime risk ({$\beta~$}=~11.875, p~=~0.001), and this relationship remained constant, despite controlling for other influences on perceived crime risk ({$\beta~$}=~9.140, p~=~0.004). The findings highlight an important paradox: that the neighbourhood characteristics known to enhance one outcome, such as walking, may negatively impact another. In this instance, the `strangers' that retail destinations attract to a neighbourhood may be interpreted by locals as a threat to safety. Thus, in areas with more retail destinations, it is vital that other environmental strategies be employed to balance any negative effects that retail may have on residents' perceptions of crime risk (e.g., minimising incivilities, improved lighting and aesthetics).},

Participants responded to the Sport Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale-2, the Youth Sport Environment Questionnaire, and the Group Conflict Questionnaire. In data analysis, we used Pearson correlations, multiple regression, latent profile analysis (LPA), and multiple analysis of variance. Regression analysis revealed that perfectionistic standards were positively associated with both task and social cohesion (p {$<$} .01), while doubts about action were negatively associated with task cohesion (p {$<$} .01). Furthermore, concern over mistakes, parental pressure, and doubts about action were positively associated with social conflict (p {$<$} .01), and concern over mistakes was positively associated with task conflict (p {$<$} .01). LPA revealed two profiles of perfectionism that we termed perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic striving. Perfectionistic striving was positively correlated with social cohesion (p {$<$} .001), and perfectionistic concerns were positively correlated with both task conflict (p {$<$} .001) and social conflict (p {$<$} .001).}

Given the exceptional nature of similar situations, only a few studies have investigated the negative psychological effects of forced social isolation and how they can be mitigated in a real context. In the present study, we investigated whether the amount of digital communication technology use for virtual meetings (i.e., voice and video calls, online board games and multiplayer video games, or watching movies in party mode) during the lockdown promoted the perception of social support, which in itself mitigated the psychological effects of the lockdown in Italy. Data were collected in March 2020 (N = 465), during the lockdown imposed to reduce the COVID-19 spread. The results indicated that the amount of digital technology use reduced feelings of loneliness, anger/irritability, and boredom and increased belongingness via the perception of social support. The present study supported the positive role of digital technologies in maintaining meaningful social relationships even during an extreme situation such as a lockdown. Implications such as the need to reduce the digital divide and possible consequences of the ongoing pandemic are discussed.}

Digital technologies have become crucial components of these projects as the tools and systems that would monitor and manage forests for storing carbon, preserving biodiversity, and providing ecosystem services. Historically, technologies have been instrumental in forming forests as spaces of conservation, extraction, and inhabitation. Digital technologies build on previous techniques of forest management, which have been shaped by colonial governance, expert science, and economic growth. However, digital technologies for achieving environmental initiatives can also extend, transform, and disrupt these sedimented practices. This article asks how the convergence of forests and digital technologies gives rise to different socio-technical formations and modalities of ``political forests.'' Through an analysis of five digital operations, including 1) observation, 2) datafication, 3) participation, 4) automation, and 5) regulation and transformation, we investigate how the co-constitution of forests, technologies, subjects, and social life creates distinct materializations of politics--and cosmopolitics. By building on and expanding the concept of cosmopolitics, we query how the political is designated through digital forest projects and how it might be reworked to generate less extractive environmental practices and relations while contributing to more just and pluralistic forest worlds.}

The study design is a quasi-experimental design, and the methods used in this study are quantitative. Student grit level was measured using a 12-item scale. The questionnaire was administered in three engineering design courses at different levels of study. The first course is an introduction to engineering design course for firstyear engineering and computer sciences students; the second is an introduction to engineering design course for second-year engineering and computer science students; and the third is a computer-aided design/computer-aidedmanufacturing (CAD/CAM) engineering design capstone course for fourth-year mechanical engineering students. Data collection occurred during the fall semester of 2018- 2019 academic year. Students' grit level was not found to be a predictor of students' peer assessment scores, although their goal orientation predicted their level of contribution to their team project.}

In the current paper we review the current situation in military communications utilizing UAV platforms, and we also explore its future trends and capabilities taking into consideration the parallel developments in the civil UAV manufacturing sector involving UAV swarms and fifth-generation networks. Furthermore, a set of realistic combat scenarios involving the utilization of UAVs as a multipurpose communication node is presented and discussed, highlighting its critical role as a catalyst for the successful accomplishment of diverse military missions.}

Although DTNs were originally designed for space-planned explorations, they can be used for crisis management in natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. One of the major disadvantages of DTNs is the lack of sufficient motivation among nodes to forward messages. This problem can lead to degradation in network performance. In this paper, we propose a method to forward messages inspired by the Landlord-Peasants game in such a way that leads to more collaboration between selfish nodes. In our proposed method, each node joins one of the coalitions. In each coalition, the sender and receiver nodes play the role of landlord and peasant, respectively. Both landlord and peasant, upon relaying a message, receive reputation. In this way, both parties have a motivation to participate in forwarding operations. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows its superiority compared to well-known baseline methods such as Direct Delivery, PRoPHET, Epidemic, and Spray\&Wait in terms of delivery ratio, buffer usage, number of hops, etc. For the sake of fairness, we also compare the proposed method with a learning-based state-of-the-art method, called K-nearest neighbors routing. The results also show that the overhead of the proposed method is not much higher than that of baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},

This study examines those factors which are bringing the two nations increasingly closer and the constraints that might stand in the way of healthy bilateral relations between them. The first section of this article deals with those areas where both the nations cooperate. The second section highlights the various constraints that make it difficult for this relationship to achieve its full potential. This article explores how India has intricately tried to maintain a delicate balance over the years by addressing the areas of constraints in a very articulate way, so that the Indo-Israeli relations in the post-Cold War era continue to flourish.}

While looking at the increasingly prominent interplay between device-based participation and technologies of advanced liberal governance in humanitarianism, I make two interrelated claims. First, I argue that ICTs do not promote the democratization of disaster response as much as they put at its disposal new tools for establishing order and security in crisis zones by facilitating the transfer of responsibility to humanitarian crowds. Second, I claim that the emergence of the crowd as a new humanitarian actor that serves the dual and potentially incommensurate purposes of resilience and witnessing perpetuates the ambiguities of a humanitarian endeavor whose inherent tensions had grown deeper since it gained its current political prominence.}

Excluded were visual/optokinetic items (cinerama, virtual reality, etc.) with low sickness prevalence, they added little information but could become important in the future. Norms and percentiles were produced (n=257). Predictive validity used controlled motions (total n=178): cross-coupled (Coriolis); 0.2Hz frequency translational oscillation; off vertical axis rotation (OVAR); visual-motion simulator. Predictive validity for motion was median r=0.51. Relationship between MSSQ-Short and other non-motion sources of nausea and vomiting (e.g. headaches, food, stress, viral, etc.) in the last 12 months was r=0.2 (p{$<$}0.01). Reliability: Cronbach's alpha 0.87; test--retest reliability around r=0.9; Part A (child) with Part B (adult) r=0.68.

For this purpose, 857 secondary school students took part in the present study. In order to test the factor structure, a confirmatory factor analysis, an exploratory factor analysis, an analysis of the reliability of the questionnaire and an analysis of temporal stability were carried out. The results showed that the factor structure consisted of two factors and four sub-factors ({\textbackslash}chi2/df = 2.17 (p = 0.001); CFI = 0.96; TLI = 0.96; IFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.051; SRMR = 0.037).

A field experiment was performed to test methods of helping female, minority, and low-income adolescents overcome the anxiety-inducing effects of stereotype threat and, consequently, improve their standardized test scores. Specifically, seventh-grade students in the experimental conditions were mentored by college students who encouraged them either to view intelligence as malleable or to attribute academic difficulties in the seventh grade to the novelty of the educational setting. Results showed that females in both experimental conditions earned significantly higher math standardized test scores than females in the control condition.

In a previous study, we found North Carolina's teenage driver cell phone restriction had little influence on young driver behavior four months after the law took effect (Foss et al., 2009). The goal of the present study was to examine the longer-term effect of North Carolina's cell phone restriction. It was expected that compliance with the restriction would increase, as awareness of the restriction grew over time. Teenagers were observed at high schools in North Carolina approximately two years after the law was implemented. Observations were also conducted in South Carolina, which did not have a cell phone restriction. In both states, there was a broad decrease in cell phone use. A logistic regression analysis showed the decrease in cell phone use did not significantly differ between the two states. Although hand-held cell phone use decreased, there was an increase in the likelihood that drivers in North Carolina were observed physically manipulating a phone. Finally, a mail survey of teenagers in North Carolina showed awareness for the cell phone restriction now stands at 78\% among licensed teens. Overall, the findings suggest North Carolina's cell phone restriction has had no long-term effect on the behavior of teenage drivers. Moreover, it appears many teenage drivers may be shifting from talking on a phone to texting.},

Subjects perceived the manual condition as more demanding than the automated one. We noted a significant increase of mind wandering frequency after only approximately 20 min under the automated condition. While learning and workload alone cannot explain these results, more automation-related phenomena, such as complacency or loss of agency, could play a role.

  abstract = {In 2010, IT-security experts from northern European governments and organizations gathered to conduct the first of a series of NATO-led cyber-defense exercises in a pilot attempt of training cyber defense. To gain knowledge on how to assess team effectiveness in cyber-defense exercises, this case study investigates the role of behavioral assessment techniques as a complement to task-based performance measurement. The collected data resulted in a massive data set including system logs, observer reports, and surveys. Six different methods were compared for feasibility in assessing the teams' performance, including automated availability check, exploratory sequential data analysis, and network intrusion detection system attack analysis. In addition, observer reports and surveys were used to collect aspects relating to team structures and processes, aiming to discover whether these aspects can explain differences in effectiveness. The cross-disciplinary approach and multiple metrics create possibilities to study not only the performance-related outcome of the exercise, but also why this result is obtained. The main conclusions found are (1) a combination of technical performance measurements and behavioral assessment techniques are needed to assess team effectiveness, and (2) cyber situation awareness is required not only for the defending teams, but also for the observers and the game control.}

Grit and growth mindset have been associated with academic achievement and success; however, little research has assessed the presence of grit and growth mindset within athletic training students. Therefor the purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in grit and growth mindset between athletic training students and non-athletic training students majoring in general health sciences and to assess the relationship between grit and growth mindset in both athletic training students and non-athletic training students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing a web-based survey to assess demographics, grit and growth mindset in undergraduate students. Univariate analyses and correlations were conducted to determine group comparisons and relationships between variables. Results: A total of 96 undergraduate students participated. Of the respondents 56\% were athletic training students, 75\% were female, and 83\% were Caucasian. There was a significant difference in grit (U=800.50, p=.014) between groups with athletic training students (M=3.70, SD=.408) reporting lower levels of grit than non-athletic training students (M=3.93, SD=.413). Intelligence and talent growth mindset yielded no significant differences. A weak, positive correlation was found between grit and intelligence growth mindset (r=.341, p=.001) as well as between grit and talent growth mindset (r=.342, p=.001). Conclusion: The current study indicated differences in grit between athletic training and non-athletic training students, but not in growth mindset. Further research is needed to identify how these factors influence success and retention within athletic training programs.}

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that narcissism is unrelated to job performance, yet this individual-level effect may be underestimating narcissism?s wider influence on organizational performance. To assess this possibility, we draw on social exchange theory and the agency model of narcissism to investigate how team narcissism composition affects team coordination and performance. Our model was tested using game-level longitudinal data from National Basketball Association teams. Teams with higher mean and maximum levels of narcissism as well as higher narcissism members in core roles (i.e., central and influential roles) had poorer coordination and in turn performance than teams with lower levels. In addition, having higher team familiarity amplified the effects of narcissism for team mean and core role narcissism. The nature of the observed interaction, however, was surprising. Originally, we hypothesized that narcissism would lead to greater decrements in coordination as familiarity increased. Instead, we found that teams with higher mean and core role narcissism maintained the same levels of coordination over time, whereas teams with lower narcissism experienced improvements in coordination. Thus, team-level narcissism appears to prevent teams from capitalizing on normative coordination gains that occur as familiarity increases. These results underscore the importance of considering narcissism when forming teams.}

The article first traces the process of discovering and circulating this corpus of information. It then considers what the digital disclosures, including 18-plus hours of aerial surveillance footage, can reveal about the racial and technological dimensions of contemporary state surveillance. In considering the agency's strategies of public admission, I develop the concept of transparency optics and identify some of its potential logics at work. I then discuss these records' epistemological limits, such as the shortcomings of analyzing digital processes through ocularcentric approaches.

The study showed a direct significant relationship between gender, age, motivation to study, and academic achievement in two education courses. Again, age, gender, motivation, and grit were significant predictors of student academic achievement in two education courses, with grit as the best predictor contributing to 67\% variability in student academic achievement. Based on the results, the study recommended that university authorities, among other things, should, through their academic and quality assurance sections, determine students' grit levels, identify those likely to have challenges, initiate appropriate measures to enhance perseverance and retention, thereby, improving academic achievement.

To characterize Grit-S scores in pharmacy students, determine whether Grit-S scores change within individual pharmacy students and cohorts over time, and investigate the relationship between Grit-S scores, academic outcomes, and professional outcomes. Methods. A survey was conducted in fall 2016 and again in fall 2017 to determine Grit-S scores in first- through fourth-year pharmacy students. Participant demographic variables, grade point average (GPA), advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) ratings, and residency match results were collected. Results. Over the study period, 852 survey responses were completed by 85\% of students surveyed. The mean Grit-S scores of each cohort ranged from 3.5 to 3.7 (on a 5-point scale with 5 representing the highest level of grit). Underrepresented minorities had slightly higher Grit-S scores and first-generation college students had slightly lower Grit-S scores. Two hundred eighty-seven students responded to both the 2016 and 2017 surveys. Among these paired responses, small but significant changes in individual Grit-S scores over time that varied in direction and magnitude by school year were noted. Higher Grit-S scores were not associated with higher GPA or superior APPE performance, nor were they predictive of a student matching to a postgraduate pharmacy residency. Conclusion. Significant associations between grit and measures of academic or professional achievement were not detected in this pharmacy student cohort. The presence of small but significant changes in Grit-S scores over time, in the absence of any intervention, has implications that further research should be conducted in this area.}

Several instruments have been developed to measure this construct in professional and educational contexts, but no tools have been developed considering specific contexts such as physical education and sport. Objectives The objective of this study is to develop and test a measurement scale to assess Grit in the context of physical education and sport. Methods Two exploratory (Phase 1) and confirmatory (Phase 2) samples were administered the 16-item PE-Grit scale in Arabic. In addition, the confirmatory sample also was administered the R-SPQ-2F two-factor learning approaches scale. The factor structure was examined first by exploratory factor analysis on the first sample and then by confirmatory factor analysis on the second sample. Reliability testing was performed by checking internal consistency simultaneously by the three indices: McDonald's {\o}mega, Cronbach's {\textbackslash}alpha and Gutmann's {\textbackslash}lambda6. Concurrent validity was checked by Pearson's correlation between the PE-Grit and the two dimensions of the SPQ-2F. Results After the exploratory factor analysis, which identified the factors and gave a preliminary validation of the designed instrument, confirmatory factor analysis was performed on three hierarchical models to be able to identify the best fitting model. A third-order hierarchical model with two physical and academic components each formed by interest and effort presented the best fit indices: chi X2 = 192.95 (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01), and the X2/DF = 1.36; GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.99; CFI and TLI close to 1; RMSEA = 0.025. In addition, McDonald's {\o}mega, internal consistency, and Gutmann's {\textbackslash}lambda6 ranged from 0.78 to 0.86 for all four scale dimensions. Conclusion The PE-Grit scale displays adequate factor structure, good reliability, and acceptable concurrent validity and can be administered to assess Grit in physical education and sport students.}

The analysis provided new observational evidence of traditional decision-making biases in red team behaviors (confirmation bias, anchoring, and take-the-best heuristic use). These biases may disrupt red team decisions and goals, and simultaneously increase their risk of detection. Interestingly, at least part of the bias induction may be related to the use of cyber deception. Future directions include the development of behavioral measurement techniques for these and additional cognitive biases in cyber operators, examining the role of attacker traits, and identifying the conditions where biases can be induced successfully in experimental conditions.}

A stated preference questionnaire is distributed to 721 individuals living across Israel and North America. Based on the characteristics of their current commutes, individuals are presented with various scenarios and asked to choose the car they would use for their commute. A vehicle choice model which includes three options is estimated:(1)Continue to commute using a regular car that you have in your possession.(2)Buy and shift to commuting using a privately-owned autonomous vehicle (PAV).(3)Shift to using a shared-autonomous vehicle (SAV), from a fleet of on-demand cars for your commute.A factor analysis determined five relevant latent variables describing the individuals' attitudes: technology interest, environmental concern, enjoy driving, public transit attitude, and pro-AV sentiments. The effects that the characteristics of the individual and the autonomous vehicle have on use and acceptance are quantified through random utility models including logit kernel model taking into account panel effects. Currently, large overall hesitations towards autonomous vehicle adoption exist, with 44\% of choice decisions remaining regular vehicles. Early AV adopters will likely be young, students, more educated, and spend more time in vehicles. Even if the SAV service were to be completely free, only 75\% of individuals would currently be willing to use SAVs. The study also found various differences regarding the preferences of individuals in Israel and North America, namely that Israelis are overall more likely to shift to autonomous vehicles. Methods to encourage SAV use include increasing the costs for regular cars as well as educating the public about the benefits of shared autonomous vehicles.},

Few studies have examined the independent effects of these traits on outcomes and the mechanisms involved. AIMS This study estimated parameters of a process model in which grit-perseverance of effort (grit-effort) and consistency of interest (grit-interest) dimensions and self-discipline were independent predictors of students' science grades. The effect of the grit-effort on grades was expected to be mediated by students' self-reported effort on optional out-of-school science learning activities. SAMPLE Secondary school students (N = 110) aged between 12 and 14 years. METHODS The study adopted a correlational design with measures taken on three occasions. Students completed self-report measures of grit and self-discipline early in the semester and effort on optional out-of-school learning activities 5 weeks later. Students' science grades were collected at the end of the semester. Data were analysed using Bayesian path analyses using non-informative and informative priors derived from previous research. RESULTS Consistent with predictions, we found effects of grit-effort on science grades mediated by effort, and self-discipline on grades. Contrary to predictions, we also found an effect of self-discipline on grades mediated by effort. Zero was a credible value for direct effects of grit-effort on grades, and grit-interest on effort and grades. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest grit-effort and self-discipline relate to effort on educational activities linked to better grades. The direct effect of self-discipline on grades suggests that it may be related to other activities that determine science attainment.},

Between April 2017 and July 2018, four aerial surveys of Big Island were undertaken to map changes to island vegetation following helicopter herbicide sprays to eradicate weeds, including the creeper Coastal Morning Glory (Ipomoea cairica) and Kikuyu Grass (Cenchrus clandestinus). The spraying was followed by a large scale planting campaign to introduce native plants, such as tussocks of Spiny-headed Mat-rush (Lomandra longifolia). Three approaches to mapping vegetation were evaluated, including: (i) a pixel-based image classification algorithm applied to the composite spectral wavebands of the images collected, (ii) manual digitisation of vegetation directly from images based on visual interpretation, and (iii) the application of a machine learning algorithm, LeNet, based on a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting planted Lomandra tussocks. The uncertainty of each approach was assessed via comparison against an independently collected field dataset. Each of the vegetation mapping approaches had a comparable accuracy; for a selected weed management and planting area, the overall accuracies were 82 \%, 91 \% and 85 \% respectively for the pixel based image classification, the visual interpretation / digitisation and the CNN machine learning algorithm. At the scale of the whole island, statistically significant differences in the performance of the three approaches to mapping Lomandra plants were detected via ANOVA. The manual digitisation took a longer time to perform than others. The three approaches resulted in markedly different vegetation maps characterised by different digital data formats, which offered fundamentally different types of information on vegetation character. We draw attention to the need to consider how different digital map products will be used for vegetation management (e.g. monitoring the health individual species or a broader profile of the community). Where individual plants are to be monitored over time, a feature-based approach that represents plants as vector points is appropriate. The CNN approach emerged as a promising technique in this regard as it leveraged spatial information from the UAV images within the architecture of the learning framework by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers to incorporate the spatial relationships between features that comprised the shape of the Lomandra tussocks detected.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to distill and define those influences under which change in objective performance level and the linked cognitive workload reflections of subjective experience and physiological variation either associate, dissociate, or are insensitive, one to another. Background: Human factors/ergonomics frequently employs users' self-reports of their own conscious experience, as well as their physiological reactivity, to augment the understanding of changing performance capacity. Under some circumstances, these latter workload responses are the only available assessment information to hand. How such perceptions and physiological responses match, fail to match, or are insensitive to the change in primary-task performance can prove critical to operational success. The reasons underlying these associations, dissociations, and insensitivities are central to the success of future effective human--machine interaction. Method: Using extant research on the relations between differing methods of workload assessment, factors influencing their association, dissociation, and insensitivity are identified. Results: Dissociations and insensitivities occur more frequently than extant explanatory theories imply. Methodological and conceptual reasons for these patterns of incongruity are identified and evaluated. Application: We often seek convergence of results in order to provide coherent explanations as bases for future prediction and practical design implementation. Identifying and understanding the causes as to why different reflections of workload diverge can help practitioners toward operational success.},

The discontinuous communication protocol technique is exploited to achieve the stability of the formation system, if the conditions of dwell time and the rate of communication are satisfied. On the basis of the local information of neighboring unmanned aerial vehicles, a novel distributed adaptive mechanism is designed to estimate the bounds of actuator faults and uncertainties, where the input saturation is explicitly taken into consideration. The stability of the whole formation system under the designed fault-tolerant formation control strategy is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

Due to the diversity of methods used to construct IEDs, unreliable information about the potential for harm may be provided to operators. Also, warfighters may search environments that are sparsely or heavily populated. Few researchers have manipulated information reliability and task criticality jointly, though these constructs often co-vary in real task situations such as IED search. Sixteen undergraduate students navigated an unmanned ground vehicle around a demarcated course and made object investigation decisions. Participants searched the environment under conditions of low and high criticality and encountered objects accompanied by low or high reliability warnings. Results showed that criticality and reliability individually and jointly impacted reaction time and navigation errors. The reported findings generally support our hypotheses and suggest additional work is necessary to replicate such effects with active duty personnel.}

Results showed that lower income students exposed to stereotype threat experienced greater test anxiety and performed worse on the academic test than their middle income and higher income counterparts. However, lower income students who experienced stereotype threat exerted as much effort on the test as lower income students who did not experience stereotype threat. Nonetheless, they were less likely to identify with school-related subjects. Stereotype threat and reduced performance did not influence lower income students' self-esteem.

Based on a comprehensive critique of their post-9/11 speeches and testimonies, we offer a four-step rhetorical schema for analyzing how President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell constructed these lies. We thus offer readers both a critique of Bush administration deceptions and the critical rhetorical tools necessary to recognize and decode future governmental deception. Then, focusing on the post-war revelations offered by Joseph Wilson, which in turn prompted a vicious administration attack on Wilson and his wife, Valerie Plame, we analyze the labyrinthine cover-up the Bush administration has used to conceal its lies about Iraqi WMD.}

Thus, this study examines how IQ and grit contribute to academic achievement gains for students in poor areas of rural China. Drawing on data from 2931 students in rural China, we measure general cognitive ability, using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven IQ); non-cognitive ability, using the Short Grit Scale; and academic achievement, using a curricular-based mathematics exam. We find that IQ and grit each predict achievement gains for the average student. Grit is not positively associated with achievement gains among low-IQ students, however, suggesting that grit does not translate into academic achievement gains for students with delays in general cognitive ability.},

We examine how academic dishonesty occurs during online learning. We review unethical behavior based on growth mindset and Grit as mediator variables. Materials and methods. The questionnaire was filled out by 266 students (196 female; 70 male) from universities in Indonesia. Data collection uses three scales, namely the academic dishonesty scale ({\textbackslash}alpha = 0.862), the growth mindset scale ({\textbackslash}alpha = 0.826), and the grit scale ({\textbackslash}alpha = 0.760). The path analysis using the multiple linear regression techniques was utilized to analyze the data in this study. Results. This study demonstrates a negative correlation between growth mindset and academic dishonesty, indicating that the more growth mindset, the less academic dishonesty. Additionally, there is a considerable negative correlation between Grit and academic dishonesty, such that the greater a person's Grit, the less academic dishonesty there is. Additionally, a positive correlation exists between the growth mindset and Grit. The greater one's growth attitude, the greater one's Grit. The primary finding is that Grit mediates the growth mindset's attitude toward academic dishonesty, implying that the growth mindset affects academic dishonesty by Grit. Conclusions. The conclusion is that the growth mindset acts as a buffer against academic dishonesty. However, Grit's position is ideal for mediating the association between growth mindset and academic dishonesty. Thus, a growth mindset can boost students' Grit, which can help prevent academic dishonesty. We reviewed recommendations for decreasing unethical behavior in online education and its consequences for higher education.}

Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. We also assess expected driving engagement of hands, feet and eyes which are shown to be lower for full autonomy compared with all other autonomy levels. This highlighted that partial autonomy, regardless of level, is perceived to require uniformly higher driver engagement than full autonomy. These results can inform experts regarding public perception of autonomy across SAE levels. The AVAM and associated questionnaire enable standardised evaluation of AVs across studies, allowing for meaningful assessment of changes in perception over time and between different technologies.},

However, in an academic environment that teaches grit and fosters growth, students can learn to persist. Those who believe intelligence is fixed and cannot be changed exert less effort to succeed.

This is the idea behind a growth mindset in learning according to Dweck (1999, 2007, 2010) and Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, and Kelly (2007). Grit can be defined as ``...passion and perseverance for long-term goals...'' (Frontiers In Psychology, 2014). One grit effect study was conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Army and the University of Pennsylvania to create predictors of retention. The purpose of this present work is to explore researched competencies related to persistence in reaching academic goals, review literature in grit and growth mindset related to learning and persistence, and examine what educators can do to foster grit and a growth mindset.

A measure of a student's ability to effortfully persist in the face of struggle, grit is proposed to be an important characteristic required for students to succeed academically (Duckworth in Journal of personality and social psychology 92:1087, 2007). Some evidence suggests that grit has a positive relationship with a range of academic outcomes, and yet others argue that grit offers little in terms of predictive value for understanding academic outcomes. In addition, there is conflicting evidence about the presence of gender differences in grit, and very little research around the role of being the first member of the family to attend university in the development of grit. In order to address conflicting findings about the importance and correlates of grit, and to explore the role of engagement in the relationship between grit and academic outcomes, a cross sectional survey study was conducted. The current research measured grit, engagement and academic productivity among 395 Australian university students. Findings suggest that there is no difference in grit between genders, although this cannot be concluded with certainty due to a large imbalance of male to female participants. It also appeared that being the first in family to attend university was associated with an increased level of the grit factor `effort'. There was a positive relationship between grit, engagement and academic productivity. Further analysis revealed that engagement mediated the relationship between grit and productivity, suggesting that a person with higher grit is more likely to have higher engagement, and that engagement leads to greater academic productivity. These findings highlight the relevance of grit as a desirable student characteristic, and the importance of engagement in the grit-productivity relationship.}

Indicators of school functionality are used to split the sample of schools into three groups (low, medium, and high functionality) and separate models of reading achievement are estimated for each group. The econometric analysis points to evidence of variation in the association between grit and reading achievement by school functionality, with a stronger association estimated for learners in more functional schools. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, this paper is one of only a handful of studies that estimate the relationship between grit and academic achievement in a middle-income country, and the first to estimate this relationship among primary school students in an African context. Second, the results provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that school characteristics interact with non-cognitive skills to produce learning outcomes, a relationship that has received scant attention in the literature to date.},

In this paper, it is argued that because the underwater environment is so harsh and challenging, operating UUVs presents human factors problems that are different from the challenges of surface unmanned systems. Several common human factors problems are discussed when using unmanned systems, including the loss of sensory cues and spatial awareness, the control of the remote vehicle, problems with situation awareness and workload, and problems with trust in automation. In each case, these issues are discussed with respect to underwater operations.}

In two studies, we examined the frequency, predictors, and health consequences of experiencing everyday discrimination at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Findings show the majority of students reported experiencing discrimination at the university, with most experiences attributed to their gender and aspects of their physical appearance. More frequent discrimination was associated with poorer physical and psychological health. Furthermore, most participants cited other students as the source of their discrimination. These findings offer important insight into students? experiences of everyday discrimination at a diverse setting.}

  abstract = {Smartphone use while driving (SUWD) is a major cause of accidents and fatal crashes. This serious problem is still too little understood to be solved. Therefore, the current research aimed to contribute to a better understanding of SUWD by examining factors that have received little or no attention in this context: problematic smartphone use (PSU), fear of missing out (FOMO), and Dark Triad. In the first step, we conducted a systematic literature review to map the current state of research on these factors. In the second step, we conducted a cross-sectional study and collected data from 989 German car drivers. A clear majority (61\%) admitted to using the smartphone while driving at least occasionally. Further, the results showed that FOMO is positively linked to PSU and that both are positively associated with SUWD. Additionally, we found that Dark Triad traits are relevant predictors of SUWD and other problematic driving behaviors----in particular, psychopathy is associated with committed traffic offenses. Thus, results indicate that PSU, FOMO, and Dark Triad are relevant factors to explain SUWD. We hope to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this dangerous phenomenon with these findings.}

The aims of this study were to compare parents' and adolescents' traffic- and crime-related safety perceptions of their neighborhood and to analyze the associations of these perceptions with adolescents' IM. A total of 291 adolescents and their parents completed the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) questionnaire. Multilevel (two-level models: individual level---neighborhood level) regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the environmental perceptions differed between parents and adolescents and the association between the parental and adolescents' perception to the IM and the active independent mobility (AIM). Parents reported a more negative perception of traffic (except for amount and speed) and crime-related safety. Adolescents' environmental perceptions were not associated with their IM but parental perceptions of traffic- and crime-related safety were associated with IM and with active IM, although not all associations were in the expected direction. Future urban policy efforts should address environments where parents perceive sufficient levels of safety to increase the levels of IM in adolescents.}

However, an under-researched question lingers over the effect of teacher-induced behaviors on academic outcomes such as grades and performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between teacher-induced autonomy support and student academic performance considering the mediating effect of basic psychological needs satisfaction, intrinsic motivation, and grit as two-independent factors. Methods: A convenience sample of 474 Sports Science students (Mage = 21.83 years; SD = 3.91) participated in the study. All participants completed a multi-section survey assessing the variables under analysis. Results: The measurement and structural model displayed acceptable fit, hence direct and indirect effects were examined among the variables of interest. Basic psychological needs and intrinsic motivation seem to display a mediating role between perceived autonomy support and academic performance, through perseverance. Contrarily, grit-passion did not exhibit a significant indirect effect. Conclusions: Current results shed new insights on how perseverance can shape student motivation and school success considering the autonomy support induced by teachers.}

We propose that the presence of relationship conflict in even a single dyad within a team can hinder information exchange, whereas the level of information exchange in teams can unlock task conflict. We argue that task and relationship conflict, due to this unfolding process, shift from an initially significant positive relationship to a null relationship over time. We further propose that task conflict and dyadic task conflict asymmetry combine to produce high performance in the teams. Our study of 219 individuals organized in 458 dyads within 51 teams -- studied over 8weeks during the development of an entrepreneurial venture -- provided support for our theoretical model. Our theory and findings demonstrate that the connection between task and relationship conflict is more complex that previously proposed, with task and relationship conflict differentiating over time.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that different operationalisations of automation transparency can influence team collaboration and performance. Yet, little is known about how gender differences can affect humans' ability to process the information provided by their automation teammate when the automation is transparent. The significance of this research question stems from the fact that the broader areas of judgment and decision making show that females and males deploy different information processing strategies. The aim of this paper is to explore whether gender differences exist in the way people interact with a transparent swarm. We conducted a user study in which 33 subjects (15 males and 18 females) interacted with a simulated swarm under two conditions: with and without transparency. While no significant differences were detected under the control condition, results indicate that when transparency was added, males were able to utilise transparency early on, while females needed significantly more time to benefit from it. Besides, under the transparency condition, females exhibited significantly longer response times than males. However, as time progresses and towards the last time window of the experiment, females could achieve slightly higher decision accuracy than males. These findings stress the need to consider gender differences when designing transparent human-machine interaction and its training protocols.}

  abstract = {Research shows that human trust in automation is a key predictor of human reliance on the automation. Several models have been proposed to capture the interplay between trust and reliance and their combined impacts on task performance. Whereas some models assume that trust is affected by automation reliability, others assume that trust is affected by automation speed. In fact, both speed and reliability can be crucial for mission performance, therefore, these models do not represent the interrelationships among automation speed, automation reliability, human decision making, and subsequent effects on mission performance. To address this gap, we propose a system dynamics model which incorporates both the speed and reliability of automation and their combined effects on trust. Our model explicitly represents the speed-accuracy compromise adopted by the subjects to weigh the perceived relative importance of these aspects while evaluating the reliance decision. The model is calibrated and evaluated using data collected from a human experiment in which 33 subjects interacted with an automated aid for swarm supervision in a foraging mission. The simulation results show that the model can closely replicate and predict the experimental data in terms of the reliance rate and the number of targets collected. Model limitations and further efforts for model extension are discussed.}

  abstract = {Objective This work aims to further test the theory that trust mediates the interdependency between automation reliability and the rate of human reliance on automation. Background Human trust in automation has been the focus of many research studies. Theoretically, trust has been proposed to impact human reliance on automation by mediating the relationship between automation reliability and the rate of human reliance. Experimentally, however, the results are contradicting as some confirm the mediating role of trust, whereas others deny it. Hence, it is important to experimentally reinvestigate this role of trust and understand how the results should be interpreted in the light of existing theory. Method Thirty-two subjects supervised a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in foraging missions in which the swarm provided recommendations on whether or not to collect potential targets, based on the information sensed by the UAVs. By manipulating the reliability of the recommendations, we observed changes in participants' trust and their behavioral responses. Results A within-subject mediation analysis revealed a significant mediation role of trust in the relationship between swarm reliability and reliance rate. High swarm reliability increased the rate of correct acceptances, but decreased the rate of correct rejections. No significant effect of reliability was found on response time. Conclusion Trust is not a mere by-product of the interaction; it possesses a predictive power to estimate the level of reliance on automation. Application The mediation role of trust confirms the significance of trust calibration in determining the appropriate level of reliance on swarm automation.},

However, these applications are often hampered because sensor nodes are energy-constrained, low-powered, with limited operational lifetime and low processing and limited power-storage capabilities. Current research shows that sensors deployed for distributed sensor network applications are low-power and low-cost devices characterized with multifunctional abilities. This contributes to their quick battery drainage, if they are to operate for long time durations. Owing to the associated cost implications and mode of deployments of the sensor nodes, battery recharging/replacements have significant disadvantages. Energy harvesting and wireless power transfer have therefore become very critical for applications running for longer time durations. This survey focuses on presenting a comprehensive review of the current literature on several wireless power transfer and energy harvesting technologies and highlights their opportunities and challenges in distributed sensor networks. This review highlights updated studies which are specific to wireless power transfer and energy harvesting technologies, including their opportunities, potential applications, limitations and challenges, classifications and comparisons. The final section presents some practical considerations and real-time implementation of a radio frequency--based energy harvesting wireless power transfer technique using PowercastTM power harvesters, and performance analysis of the two radio frequency--based power harvesters is discussed. Experimental results show both short-range and long-range applications of the two radio frequency--based energy harvesters with high power transfer efficiency.}

Different working environments and applications pose diverse challenges by adding constraints on the choice of sensors, degree of autonomy, and dynamics of a person-following robot. Researchers have addressed these challenges in many ways and contributed to the development of a large body of literature. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the literature by categorizing different aspects of person-following by autonomous robots. Also, the corresponding operational challenges are identified based on various design choices for ground, underwater, and aerial scenarios. In addition, state-of-the-art methods for perception, planning, control, and interaction are elaborately discussed and their applicability in varied operational scenarios is presented. Then some of the prominent methods are qualitatively compared, corresponding practicalities are illustrated, and their feasibility is analyzed for various use cases. Furthermore, several prospective application areas are identified, and open problems are highlighted for future research.}

Using a phishing-detection system as a testbed in this article, we systematically varied automation error type and the method of communicating system reliability in a factorial design and measured their effects on human performance and trust in the automation. Participants were asked to classify emails as legitimate or phishing with assistance from the phishing-detection system. The results from 510 participants suggest that learning through experience with feedback improved trust calibration for both objective and subjective trust measures in most conditions. Moreover, false alarms lowered trust more than misses for both unreliable and reliable systems, and false alarms turned out to be beneficial for proper trust calibration when using unreliable systems. Design implications of the results include using feedback whenever possible and choosing false alarms over misses for unreliable systems.}

In a 2 (ASM transparency) {\texttimes} 2 (ASM reliability) within-subject design experiment, participants monitored a simulated soldier squad that included an ASM as it traversed a simulated training environment, while concurrently monitoring the environment for targets. There was no difference in participants' performance on the target detection task, workload, or SA due to either ASM transparency or reliability. ASM reliability influenced participant trust and perceptions of the robot. Results suggest that reliability may be a stronger influence on the human's perceptions of the robot than transparency. Robot errors had a profound and lasting effect on the participants' perception of the robot's future reliability and resulted in reduced confidence in their assessments of the robot's reliability. These findings could have important implications for the continued use of automated systems when the user is aware of system errors.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop the analytical framework for a novel Wireless signal-based Sensing capability for Robotics (WSR) by leveraging a robots' mobility in 3D space. It allows robots to primarily measure relative direction, or Angle-of-Arrival (AOA), to other robots, while operating in non-line-of-sight unmapped environments and without requiring external infrastructure. We do so by capturing all of the paths that a wireless signal traverses as it travels from a transmitting to a receiving robot in the team, which we term as an AOA profile. The key intuition behind our approach is to enable a robot to emulate antenna arrays as it moves freely in 2D and 3D space. The small differences in the phase of the wireless signals are thus processed with knowledge of robots' local displacement to obtain the profile, via a method akin to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The main contribution of this work is the development of (i) a framework to accommodate arbitrary 2D and 3D motion, as well as continuous mobility of both signal transmitting and receiving robots, while computing AOA profiles between them and (ii) a Cramer--Rao Bound analysis, based on antenna array theory, that provides a lower bound on the variance in AOA estimation as a function of the geometry of robot motion. This is a critical distinction with previous work on SAR-based methods that restrict robot mobility to prescribed motion patterns, do not generalize to the full 3D space, and require transmitting robots to be stationary during data acquisition periods. We show that allowing robots to use their full mobility in 3D space while performing SAR results in more accurate AOA profiles and thus better AOA estimation. We formally characterize this observation as the informativeness of the robots' motion, a computable quantity for which we derive a closed form. All analytical developments are substantiated by extensive simulation and hardware experiments on air/ground robot platforms using 5 GHz WiFi. Our experimental results bolster our analytical findings, demonstrating that 3D motion provides enhanced and consistent accuracy, with a total AOA error of less than 10{\textopenbullet} for 95\% of trials. We also analytically characterize the impact of displacement estimation errors on the measured AOA and validate this theory empirically using robot displacements obtained using an off-the-shelf Intel Tracking Camera T265. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our system on a multi-robot task where a heterogeneous air/ground pair of robots continuously measure AOA profiles over a WiFi link to achieve dynamic rendezvous in an unmapped, 300 m2 environment with occlusions.}

  abstract = {Grit is defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. 5 As a trait, grit has been measured in the educational realm and the associated metric has shown to reliably predict a significant percent of student `success'. This paper describes the initial work of an ongoing longitudinal study to measure the grit of first-year engineering students using a validated and established self-reporting survey tool. 5 Preliminary results of the survey show that there are significant differences in grit scores among student cohorts of gender and student athletes; there are some measurable differences across academic levels and differences among engineering majors. Trends exist between Honors and Non-honors students, yet there is little correlation with SAT scores or absolute age at the university level. Our hypothesis is that students can be better set up for success if they possess more grit, more toughness and determination. While both grit and success may be challenging to define and measure by some standards, we anticipate this research will provide new insights and direction for continued efforts in cultivating the engineers of 2020.}

The aim of this study was to describe the attitudes of New Zealand parents towards such risky play practices and independent mobility, the barriers preventing them from allowing their children to participate, and how often their children engaged in risky play activities. An online survey comprised mostly of validated scales and standardised questions was completed by a nationally representative sample of 2003 parents. We found that parents had neutral feelings about the risk of injury to their child through play, rather they were concerned about road safety and \&ldquo;stranger danger\&rdquo;. There was strong agreement that there are multiple benefits to be gained from exposure to risk and challenge, and that health and safety rules are too strict. However, 73\% of respondents stated that their 5\&ndash;12 year old child seldom or never engaged in four or more risky activities, and only 14.3\% engaged in four or more often or always. While parents agree that their child is likely to benefit from risky play, they do not have the confidence to allow their children to engage in such activities. Future research should address barriers and fears when implementing strategies to facilitate risky play.},

Participants were 3107 7th grade high school students from a large city in mainland China. A multilayer model was designed wherein grit was at the trait layer, and academic self-efficacy, as well as cognitive learning strategies, were at state and behavior layers. The direct and indirect effects were estimated using a multilevel mediation model with random intercepts and fixed slopes. The current study generated three main findings: First, students with a higher level of the perseverance of effort (one dimension of grit) use cognitive learning strategies more frequently, and the relations between the perseverance of effort and each strategy are slightly different. Second, academic self-efficacy act as a significant mediator in the relationship between perseverance of effort and cognitive learning strategy. Finally, different cognitive learning strategies showed unique or even contrast effects on academic performance, indicating the significance of separating different strategies when considering their relations with performance. Findings of the study could be applied as guidance to educators. Specifically, students' academic performance is affected by personality traits, academic motivation, and learning behaviors. Therefore, in practice, developing students' grit (especially perseverance of effort), helping them establish and enhance academic self-efficacy, and teaching them appropriate learning strategies can help with their academic achievement.}

Results indicated reciprocal effects between overall grit and academic achievement, but PE and CI showed differential roles. Specifically, PE at Time 1 accounted for 2.3\% variance in academic achievement at Time 2 after controlling students' age, family SES, self-control and previous academic achievement. Reverse relation was found that previous achievement level contributed to later PE development. However, CI failed to predict academic achievement and vice versa.

Models cover unidirectional spine arrays and pairs of opposed arrays that withstand normal forces pulling away from a surface. Experiments on a variety of surfaces confirm the predicted behavior. For opposed spine arrays, the overall load capability also depends on the preloading strategy for applying internal forces. Insights from the analysis guide the design of spine array mechanisms to allow, for example, a small aerial platform to attach to walls and ceilings.}

This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents' intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents' intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents' intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents' intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents' intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents' acceptance of AVs.},

The design of urban environment, in which the families lived, was assessed by a group of five experts. By means of multiple regression analyses it was found that the parents' attitude towards chauffeuring was related to environmental factors such as traffic environment, quality of footpaths and cycle paths, and sense of community as well as the number of cars in the household. The attitude towards independent travel was related to characteristics of the child, such as age and maturity, and individual parental factors, such as trust and the need to protect their child, and whether there were older children in the household. Both the relative frequency of journeys made independently and by car was related to the parent's attitude towards independent travel, as well as environmental and parental factors. To decrease car usage and increase children's independent travel to leisure activities, planners and policy-makers should focus on improvements in the traffic environment and promote a favourable attitude towards independent travel.}

Once inside the network, establishing a foothold, or beachhead, malicious actors can collect sensitive information, scan targets, and execute an attack.Increasing defensive capabilities through cyber deception shows great promise by providing an opportunity to delay and disrupt an attacker once network perimeter security has already been breached. Traditional Human Factors research and methods are designed to mitigate human limitations (e.g., mental, physical) to improve performance. These methods can also be used combatively to upend performance. Oppositional Human Factors (OHF), seek to strategically capitalize on cognitive limitations by eliciting decision-making errors and poor usability. Deceptive tactics to elicit decision-making biases might infiltrate attacker processes with uncertainty and make the overall attack economics unfavorable and cause an adversary to make mistakes and waste resources.Two online experimental platforms were developed to test the Sunk Cost Fallacy in an interactive, gamified, and abstracted version of cyber attacker activities. This work presents the results of the Cypher platform. Offering a novel approach to understand decision-making and the Sunk Cost Fallacy influenced by factors of uncertainty, project completion and difficulty on progress decisions. Results demonstrate these methods are effective in delaying attacker forward progress, while further research is needed to fully understand the context in which decision-making limitations do and do not occur.

The Human Computer Trust Scale (HCTS) and the Trust in Automated Systems Scale (TAS) were used to measure trust. When examining scores on TAS items with a positive-valence, we novelly observed that transparency interacted with reliability, such that high transparency and low reliability negatively impacted trust in the system. Alternatively, trust was not negatively affected by poor reliability when transparency was low, due to trivial cost of corrective behaviors that compensated for poor reliability and lack of system history understanding by the operators.}

In Study 2, 64 children role-played successful tasks and received either person, outcome, or process praise.

Results indicated that children displayed significantly more "helpless" responses (including self-blame) on all dependent measures after person criticism or praise than after process criticism or praise.

All were given the Grit Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the short Warwick--Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, the Office of National Statistics Well-being items and the Self-Control Scale. Levels of grit were significantly higher in female students, older students and postgraduates. Grit correlated highest with self-control. Study 2 looked at 340 University students. In addition to measuring self-control, mental well-being and grit, measures of resilience and mindsets were also added. A construct validity test of the Grit Scale showed that high grit scorers had significantly higher levels of self-control and mental well-being, were more resilient and were more likely to have a more growth oriented mindset. Grit varies with age and is most closely associated with the concept of self-control. The third study was a qualitative investigation with 10 successful graduates. Semi-structured interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Three broad themes emerged. The first, Passion and Perseverance, included themes of having short and long terms goals, resilience, dedication, and endurance. The second, Self-Control, included time management, self-awareness, prioritizing tasks and knowing strengths and weaknesses. The third theme identified was Positive Mindsets. This included having a positive attitude toward learning, the importance of feedback and constructive criticism and that success is not materialistic. The qualitative research has helped ``unpack'' concepts from the grit research and may enable University tutors to guide students better. Though these studies were only conducted in one English University, they have been stepping stones in our quest to discover what are the most important factors in determining student academic success? The development and piloting of our new Uni-Stride Scale, is the next step in this process.}

The authors have developed a short 12-item measure of tenacity, the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS) which incorporates these elements. Previous work in the UK had established the reliability and validity of the BUSS. The present paper reports the findings of an International validation of BUSS across 30 countries (n = 1043). Participants completed the BUSS alongside other recognised scales. Factor analysis revealed an almost identical two-factor solution to previous work and the reliability and validity of the scale were supported using an international sample. The authors recommend however that the scale be used as a single score combining all 12 items. In the light of this, the authors suggest that the BUSS will be a useful measure to incorporate in studies of academic attainment.}

More recently, the construct of grit, has attracted the attention of many researchers, along with related concepts such as self-control, growth mind-sets and resilience. The authors of this paper have developed a specific measure of tenacity and self-composure, two constructs crucial to academic achievement. This measure comprises of 12 items drawn from the above constructs, but also including mental well-being and strengths use. In the first study, the authors report on the psychometric properties of the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS). The new scale was administered to 1117 university students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed two underlying factors, one labelled ``tenacity'' had seven items and accounted for 30\% of the variance. The second was labelled ``self-composure,'' and accounted for 14\% of the variance. In the second study the BUSS was given to 340 undergraduate students along with the Grit Scale, the Self-Control Scale, the Mind-sets Quiz, the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) and the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). This study presented evidence for good internal consistency reliability (.74) and test-retest reliability over three weeks was .70 for Tenacity and .77 for Self-composure. BUSS Academic Tenacity correlated highly with grit (.63), self-control (.59), resilience (.52), mind-sets (.35) and mental well-being (.54). The study also evidences good discriminative validity of the BUSS. A second study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), explaining a total of 44\% of the variance. The authors have shown good support for the reliability and validity of the BUSS scale. It now needs to be tested in other universities and in different countries. It is the contention of the authors that academic tenacity will be a better measure of academic success than other competing measures, such as grit, on their own. Further research is needed to test this assertion.}

Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are believed to have the potential to revolutionise last-mile delivery in a way that is more sustainable and customer focused. However, if not widely accepted, the introduction of ADVs as a delivery option can be a substantial waste of resources. At present, the research on consumers' receptivity of innovations in last-mile delivery, such as ADVs, is limited. This study is the first that investigates the users' acceptance of ADVs in Germany by utilising an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and adapted it to the context of ADVs in last-mile delivery. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey approach (n~=~501) and structural equation modelling was undertaken. The results indicate that price sensitivity is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention (i.e., user acceptance), followed by performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, perceived risk, social influence and facilitating conditions, whereas no effect could be found for effort expectancy. These findings have important theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of technology acceptance and last-mile delivery.},

Participants concurrently performed a manual tracking task with two levels of difficulty and a system monitoring task assisted by an unreliable signaling system. Eye movement data indicate that operators allocate less visual attention to monitor automation when the tracking task is more difficult. Participants reported reduced levels of trust toward the signaling system when the tracking task demanded more focused visual attention. Analyses revealed that trust mediated the relationship between the load of the tracking task and attention allocation in Experiment 1, an effect that was not replicated in Experiment 2. Results imply a complex process underlying task load, visual attention allocation, and automation trust during multitasking. Automation designers should consider operators' task load in multitasking workspaces to avoid reduced automation monitoring and distrust toward imperfect signaling systems.},

Nevertheless, no scientific evidence has been reported so far with regards to the impact on road safety and driving behavior. This paper investigates the effect of COVID-19 on driving behavior and safety indicators captured through a specially developed smartphone application and transmitted to a back-end platform. These indicators are reflected with the spread of COVID-19 and the respective governmental countermeasures in two countries, namely Greece and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which had the most completed routes for users of the smartphone applications. It was shown that reduced traffic volumes due to lockdown, led to a slight increase in speeds by 6--11\%, but more importantly to more frequent harsh acceleration and harsh braking events (up to 12\% increase) as well mobile phone use (up to 42\% increase) during March and April 2020, which were the months where COVID-19 spread was at its peak. On the bright side, accidents in Greece were reduced by 41\% during the first month of COVID-19-induced measures and driving in the early morning hours (00:00--05:00) which are considered dangerous dropped by up to 81\%. Policymakers should concentrate on establishing new speed limits and ensure larger spaces for cycling and pedestrians in order to enlarge distances between users in order to safeguard both an enhanced level of road safety and the prevention of COVID-19 spread.},

ABSTRACT In recent years, Dweck (2014) and Duckworth (2016) introduced two important concepts in student learning: mindsets and grit. These variables can drastically change the way individuals handle a learning situation, the degree of effort and persistence they display, and eventually, their level of achievement. Recent literature on self-theories recommends using domain-specific rather than domain-general instruments to explain school achievement. Furthermore, child samples are relatively understudied compared to adolescent and youth samples in terms of self-theories and achievement relations. This study focuses on math mindsets, academic grit, and their relation to math achievement at the primary school level. Math mindsets scale, academic grit scale, and a math achievement test were used as data collection instruments. Data were collected from purposively selected 225 4 th grade students in Istanbul, Turkey. A cross-sectional causal model has been tested through structural equation modeling (SEM). There was not a direct effect of growth math mindset but a significant negative effect of fixed math mindset on math achievement. The indirect effect of growth math mindset on math achievement mediated by academic grit was positive and significant; the indirect effect of fixed math mindset was non-significant. Finally, the effect of academic grit on math achievement was positive and significant. The SEM model explained 36\% of the variance in math achievement and 64\% of academic grit. School-based interventions are recommended to promote a growth math mindset and academic grit. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed in detail.}

This study tests two different hypotheses: additive vs. averaging. Background: Keller and Rice (accepted) showed that operators tend to use a system-wide trust strategy when using multiple automation aids instead of evaluating the reliability of each aid separately. Operators using system-wide trust may combine their experience with the aids using either an additive or an averaging method. Method: 48 participants monitored one or two gauges, each with an automated aid at different reliability levels, while engaged in a pursuit tracking task that simulated an unmanned aerial vehicle mission flight. Results: After accounting for increased difficulty of using two gauges vs. one gauge, the results showed that participants still performed worse when using two gauges vs. one gauge even though all the aids were the same reliability. Conclusion: The results revealed that the additive hypothesis best predicted the data. Application: This study points to a topic that designers and users of systems with multiple aids should carefully consider.}

While both risk and trust have been the focus of interest for AV researchers, studies have often produced contradictory results. This study offers a new perspective to investigate the effect of trust and perceived risk to resolve these ambiguities. We identified three underlying dimensions of trust supplemented by two dimensions of risk and incorporated them into one model. The proposed model offers direct and indirect paths between trust dimensions and AV acceptance with the mediation of the dimensions of perceived risk. Based on a survey of 949 adult respondents, the model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). Results revealed that only performance trust affected directly intention to use AVs, while trust in manufacturers influenced intention to use with the mediation of privacy risk. An important result is that trust in institutions that can influence future rules and regulations for the use of AVs has no impact either directly or indirectly on intention to use. The practical implications can assist regulators and manufacturers to increase their efforts to build trust and confidence, thus enhancing the adoption of this technology.},

  abstract = {Teleoperation of unmanned vehicles in high stress environments has been a subject of research in many domains, which focus primarily on system and operator performance. Unmanned ground vehicles for rescue, also known as search and rescue robots, serve as extensions of responders in a disaster, providing real-time video and other relevant information about the situation. However, physically separating responder and robot introduces latency between the human input provided to the unmanned vehicle to execute an operation and the subsequent response provided by the system. This latency (lag or time delay) is determined by the distance and the bandwidth of the connection between the operator and the unmanned vehicle. Automating these systems may mitigate the effect of latency to an extent; however, this has its own consequences, such as leaving the responder out of the loop, which subsequently leads to detrimental effects on situational awareness. This research investigates the relationship between latency and the performance of the human operator of a teleoperated robot at different levels of system complexity and the effect of different levels of automation on this relationship. Eighty participants operated one or two unmanned teleoperated robots to complete two search and rescue tasks. The study utilized a 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed-subjects experimental design with the automation level and latency level being the between-subjects factors and the system complexity (controlling one or two robots) being the within-subjects factor. The dependent variables were operator performance, perceived workload, and the subjective rating of trust with automation. A latency of 500 ms showed a significant decrease in performance in time to complete the task and a significant increase in the perceived physical workload. Both the automation level and latency level moderated the system complexity effect on the subjective rating of trust in the robotic system. The level of trust decreased over time in the one-robot condition as opposed to no change in the two-robot condition. The error rate decreased over time at different rates based on the number of robots or the latency level. Based on the results of the study, several design implications are suggested for improving performance including adding features to the automation that will allow the operator to use common strategies and providing necessary information using multiple sensory channels. Future research directions are also proposed.},

The present study aimed to build on the existing literature on grit by investigating the relationship between grit, big five personality and L2 achievement. The participants of this study were 384 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students from different academic majors studying at Yazd University. They had enrolled in General English (GE) courses. The results of the cluster analyses showed that there were three natural grit profiles (Cluster 1 = High Perseverance and High Consistency; Cluster 2 = High Perseverance and Low Consistency; Cluster = Low Perseverance and High Consistency) in the current study. The results of the multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that students belonging to cluster 1 had the highest scores on big five personality traits and L2 achievement. The results also showed that when taking academic exams, high perseverance of effort and low consistency of interest were related to higher level of neuroticism and lower level of consciousness. Our study has some theoretical and practical implications. Regarding the theory, this study is related to the existing grit literature by elaborating the relationship between grit profiles, big five personality traits, and L2A. Regarding the practice, our findings affirm the significance of developing and implementing the big five personality traits interventions in grit prediction.}

Overall, the final GERD app includes important features for tracking symptoms and triggers, analytics, data export, and community information, while promoting individualization, accessibility, and usability. The documentation of the design process of this app serves as a reference point for future medical app developers as it followed an empirically supported user-centered design strategy and resulted in an app which received positive feedback from users and human factors experts. We also intend to share some of the limitations due to the constrained resources, as well as potential ways to strengthen the design process for mHealth applications.},

We used a human performance model and a laboratory study involving 24 participants to examine the effect of applying a notional, automated parser to present audio in a particular ear depending on information relevance. Operator workload and performance were assessed while subjects listened for and responded to relevant audio cues associated with critical information among additional noncritical information. Encoding relevance through spatial location in a spatial audio display system--as opposed to monophonic, binaural presentation--significantly reduced response time and workload, particularly for noncritical information. Future auditory displays employing spatial cues to indicate relevance have the potential to reduce workload and improve operator performance in similar task domains.

First, automated subway-specific trustworthiness factors are identified through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, the effects of the identified factors on passenger anxiety and fear are examined using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that attributes that contribute to the trustworthiness of automated subways are grouped into automation- and service-related factors: `automation trustworthiness' and `service trustworthiness', both of which appear to negatively affect passengers' anxiety and fear, mediated by the passengers' sense of certainty and coping potential. The negative effects of trustworthiness on anxiety and fear indicate that strengthening of the trustworthiness factors must be accompanied with technological advances in transportation. The implications for strengthening the trustworthiness of unmanned automated subways and other transport services employing autonomous features are presented, correspondingly, in this study.},

  abstract = {Background Childhood abuse is prevalent in those with substance use disorders (SUDs), and can lead to adverse consequences, including relapse to substance use following treatment. Objective To determine whether anxiety sensitivity (AS) and grit mediate associations between childhood abuse and substance use relapse risk. Participants and setting Patients on an inpatient detoxification and stabilization unit seeking treatment for SUDs (N = 702). Methods Participants were administered self-report measures assessing childhood physical and sexual abuse (CPA/CSA), AS, grit, and relapse risk. A parallel mediation model was used to investigate the association between childhood abuse and relapse risk as mediated by AS and grit. Results Anxiety sensitivity was associated with greater relapse risk ({$\beta$} = 0.29, t = 8.24, p {$<$} 0.001). Indirect effects of CPA and CSA on relapse risk through AS were statistically significant (CPA: {$\beta$} = 0.05, 95 \% C.I. = 0.02-0.08; CSA: {$\beta$} = 0.04, 95 \% C.I. = 0.01-0.07), indicating AS significantly mediated effects of both CPA and CSA on relapse risk. Grit was not a mediator, however, higher grit score was significantly associated with decreased relapse risk ({$\beta$} = -0.17, t = -4.90, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions Anxiety sensitivity may be an important construct linking child abuse to relapse risk. Although grit may not mediate the effect of child abuse on relapse risk, it may be clinically relevant to relapse risk. As this sample consisted of treatment-seeking adults, the generalizability of results to other populations is uncertain. Future studies should investigate interventions targeting these constructs in this population.},

This study discusses the relationship between personality traits and the use of smartphones by 221 young drivers (64.7\% male) aged 17--22\,years. It focuses on the mediation effect of smartphone addiction on the relationship between personality and smartphone use while driving, using an objective measure---the number of times young drivers touch their smartphones, measured by a unique smartphone monitoring application. Results show that participants touched their smartphones on average 1.71 times per minute while driving. They also indicate a negative relationship between participants' openness to experience and smartphone use while driving, a positive relationship between both extraversion and neuroticism and smartphone use while driving, and a mediation effect of smartphone addiction on the relationship between neuroticism and smartphone use while driving. This is the first study to identify relationships between psychological variables and smartphone use while driving based on a real-time objective measurement. The ability to predict such use may lead to a personalized intervention that will reduce addiction to the smartphone and help drivers refrain from using smartphones while driving.},

  abstract = {Operators generalize their trust across all of the autonomous agents they are working with, a phenomenon referred to as System Wide Trust (SWT). As a result, the failure of one aid can cause a trust decrement in ---and therefore disuse of--- all other competent aids within the system. This study explored two possible SWT mitigation strategies: competence transparency and different appearance of aids. Previous research has shown that transparency and feedback affects trust calibration in systems (Walliser et al., 2016), yet our appearance manipulation is relatively novel, using gestalt principles of grouping to explore whether heterogeneous aids will be more easily differentiated compared to homogenous aids. Participants supervised four UAVs that identified targets as enemies or friendlies. Only one of these UAVs was inaccurate (70\% recommended accuracy), which caused a SWT trust decrement for all UAVs. We expected that the heterogeneous UAVs with competence transparency would suffer the least SWT effect, yet the results did not find a difference between conditions. These findings suggest that the System Wide Trust effect is too strong to be affected by our manipulations and that further research on mitigation strategies is required.}

This development raises the question about properties collaborative robots (cobots) need, to enable a pleasant and smooth interaction. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of transparency and reliability on perception of and trust towards cobots. A video-enhanced online study with 124 participants was conducted. Transparency was provided through the presentation of differing information, and reliability was manipulated through differing error rates. The results showed a positive effect of transparency on perceived safety and intelligence. Reliability had a positive effect on perceived intelligence, likeability and trust. The effect of reliability on trust was more pronounced for low transparent robots. The results indicate the relevance of carefully selected information to counteract negative effects of failures. Future research should transfer the study design into a real-life experiment with more fine-grained levels of transparency and reliability.}

These tasks vary in cognitive complexity, ranging from low-level sensory processing to high-level decision making. Cognitive load, a measure of the effort required by the working memory, can serve as an indicator of tasks that may have higher risk of error. Task decomposition models for cognitive complexity can be combined with objective and subjective measures of workload to measure human performance in response to control room stimuli. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a cognitive task analysis approach to structure the design of experiments for the purpose of evaluating human performance in control room simulated use activities. Participants completed monitoring tasks in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control room that required the completion of tasks ranging in cognitive complexity. Performance measures taken during the study were used to validate the breakdown of tasks complexity, and to identify potential sources of human error in workstation monitoring tasks. These findings can be linked to design specifications for workstation optimization. Results indicated that the task breakdown appropriately represented the use-case scenario, and the classification model adequately captured differences in cognitive workload experienced by participants. This research has broad implications on complex system design validation, providing a structure to achieve cognitive depth for the evaluation of human performance and subsequent design risk mitigation.},

  abstract = {This work presents a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) for estimating the relative state of a multirotor vehicle operating in a GPS-denied environment. The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date. This article presents several improvements and extensions to the filter while clearly defining all quaternion conventions and properties used, including several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this article derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicle's body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations.}

Factor analysis revealed that independent mobility comprised activities in public places, including outings to supermarkets, and traveling by bus and train as well as activities in the school district such as visiting friends' homes and parks. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses that comprised five steps were conducted in which the number of days of attending lessons and cram school was entered in the final step. There was a strong gender effect and grade effect for outings to public places and activities in the school district. Concerns about traffic accidents and security were associated with lower independent mobility. With regard to activities in the school district, proximity to school, use of bicycles, and possession of house keys had a positive effect. It is noteworthy that the effect of the number of days spent attending lessons or cram school was observed even after the other variables were entered, thus resulting in a negative effect. It is recommended that further comparative studies involving other Asian countries be conducted to evaluate the effects of extracurricular activities.}

Data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 and AMOS 23.0 program with Pearson correlation, structural equation model and bootstrapping. The main results were as follows. 1) Children's academic stress had a negative influence on their grit. 2) Children's grit had a negative influence on their executive function difficulty and media device addiction. 3) Children's executive function difficulty had a positive influence on their media device addiction. 4) The relationship between children's academic stress and media device addiction was mediated by their grit and executive function difficulty. This study is significant in the sense that it found protective factors and risk factors for children's addiction to media devices. We suggest that children's grit be improved, and their academic stress and executive function difficulty be reduced to prevent and mediate children's media device addiction.}

Most participants reported that they would 'never' use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) (43.5\%). The results of a logistic regression model showed that participants' age, gender, level of education, propensity for technology adoption, aberrant driving behaviours, awareness of advanced driver assistance safety (ADAS) technologies, perceived knowledge regarding automated vehicles, as well their requirements for assurance-related vehicle features were significantly associated with their willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren), {$\chi$}2(12)~=~137.41, p~{$<~$}0.001). Overall, the findings suggest that Australian parents are mostly unwilling to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) unless various reassurance features and technologies (i.e., microphones, camera, ability to summon assistance if the vehicle breaks down) are embedded in the vehicle. Therefore, automated vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to consider these requirements when prototyping their designs so that all user groups, including child occupants, can benefit from the impending arrival of automated technologies.},

Although people process information about a conflict using the same general cognitive and emotional mechanisms, their personal characteristics (e.g., personality, cultural background), beliefs and motives (e.g., orientation toward conflict), and past experiences will influence how they make sense of what is occurring and their subsequent conflict behavior. Building on recent work that has taken a multi-level approach to understanding team conflict and drawing from related literature in social, cognitive, and personality psychology, we explicate an individual's psychological experience of a conflict episode as a process by which individuals make sense of and emotionally experience what is happening, develop attitudes towards others in the group, and exchange and integrate knowledge about the conflict and others involved. We argue that a more nuanced understanding of the intraindividual experience of conflict generates important insight into understanding individual conflict behavior, helping us predict how people will behave in conflict situations and how conflict episodes will unfold. We conclude with implications for how to intervene to promote cooperative behavior and positive team outcomes, along with an agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {Recent research in psychology introduces ``grit'' as a characteristic observable in successful students (Duckworth, 2016). Popular applications of the grit framework can further the notion of "rugged individualism," placing the onus of achievement upon the individual. This perspective can lead failures to be considered the result of deficiencies, overlooking effects of structural factors associated with learning. Sociologically, certain applications of grit can be limited in explaining mobility: they may not address the social contexts of the people they assess; or, they may lack a dynamic understanding of students' cultures. This article applies a qualitative, sociological framework offering ``agency'' as a concept to complement grit and understand social structures, which facilitate student mobility. Through in-depth interviews, this research gives voice to students who experienced significant upward mobility, despite low-income backgrounds. These cases suggest that interplay between personal agency and a supportive social structure is necessary for students to navigate barriers towards academic and professional success.}

Through our analysis we show that while many students experience marginalization and threats to their identity, they display no less grit than those who do not experience marginalization and threats to their identity. Background There are contentious debates in higher education about the role that universities should play in promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion principles. Existing arguments rarely consider students' social identity in conjunction with their academic mindsets and ability to succeed in the graduate school environment, but instead make assumptions of who students are and of what they are capable. Methodology Survey methods and quantitative analyses, including regression and ANOVA testing. Perseverance Despite the Perception of Threat and Marginalization 126 Contribution While demonstrating that students who experience marginalization and social identity threat display no less grit than their counterparts, we claim that all students would still desire to live and work in a society in which their social identities are respected and honored. Findings Many students, even those successfully navigating graduate school, still identify as oppressed or marginalized, which is strongly related to certain social identities and to social identity threat. No demographic or oppression-based variable alone correlates negatively or positively with perseverance as tested by the grit scale we used. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend that universities uphold a commitment to diversity and inclusion in order to create welcoming environments for all students to thrive. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend that researchers focus on the intersections of identity, perseverance, and policy to fully address the issues of marginalization and social identity threat at graduate school campuses. Impact on Society Our paper works to counter the often-negative perception of students who identify as marginalized and who demand more inclusive university environments. Future Research In future studies, it would be beneficial for the field to address other social identities and examine their perceptions of marginalization and inclusion and assess impacts on academic mindset.}

Participants were twenty graduate students recruited from an introductory public health biostatistics class. Students were assessed three times during one semester. At each time point, students completed assessments of growth mindset, grit, social and emotional health, and attitudes toward statistics. Student grades were collected from the course instructor. Descriptive results indicate that growth mindset, grit, and social and emotional health fluctuated little over time. Mean scores for four attitudes toward statistics components improved over time. We found limited relationships between growth mindset and final grades. Growth mindset-based strategies may be more impactful at a persona, rather than academic, level.

Using the robust variance estimation, we found that the correlations of overall grit level with academic achievement were generally weak to moderate (weighted r = .19). The correlation of perseverance of effort to achievement (weighted r = .21) was stronger than that of consistency of interest (weighted r = .08). Adopting a cross-cultural perspective in reviewing these findings, we concluded that the associations between overall grit/2 facets and academic achievement did not differ across individualism-collectivism. We also investigated 7 other moderators, including grit measurement, types of achievement measures, publication type, educational levels, research design, study quality, and the female ratio of sampling in the grit-achievement relationship. After controlling for all proposed moderators, no significant moderators were found in the overall grit-achievement link or the consistency of interest-achievement link. There was a significantly stronger association between perseverance of effort and academic achievement in nonstandardized measures than in standardized measures. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

New innovative solutions are needed to increase the quality and efficiency of asset management to avoid corresponding growth in resources and cost. To this end, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a range of possibilities. Here, we present a novel prototype solution for autonomous and remotely operated inspection missions with resident drones on electrical substations, comprising: (1) an autonomous drone with sense and avoid and robustness to harsh weather capability; (2) a drone hangar for remote operations; and (3) drone operations and data acquisition management software. Further, we discuss the possibilities and challenges that such a system offers and give an overview of requirements that are key to realizing the potential of drones for improved asset management. These requirements are based on years of operational experience with electrical substations combined with the lessons learned during the development and testing of our drone system. We also experimentally investigate safety distances between the drone and high-voltage infrastructure. We demonstrate the usefulness of our autonomous inspection solution through extensive field testing at one of Statnett's fully operational electrical substations.}

Moreover, the cumulative effects of multiple risk and protective factors on their emotional well-being are even less covered in the existing literature. Guided by a risk and resilience ecological framework, the current study compared emotional well-being, operationalized as positive affect and negative affect, between Chinese adolescents who had switched schools and their non-switch counterparts, and examined the direct and interactive effects of teacher autonomy support and two facets of grit (i.e., perseverance and consistency) on emotional well-being in both groups. A propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the two groups in terms of sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and socioeconomic status). A total of 371 adolescents who had switched schools and 742 non-switch counterparts aged from 13 to 18 years were involved in this study. Results indicated that adolescents who had switched schools reported higher levels of negative affect than their non-switch counterparts. Moreover, for adolescents who had switched schools, those who possessed higher levels of perseverance had a significantly negative association between teacher autonomy support and negative affect; however, the corresponding association was independent of perseverance for their non-switch counterparts. The current findings indicate that switching schools is a disadvantage for adolescents' emotional states. However, teacher autonomy support and perseverance can protect adolescents who switch schools as critical stress-buffering factors against these negative feelings.}

We used video oculography to record gaze position in the presence and in the absence of a fixational stimulus, in a safe and a verbal threat condition in subjects characterised for their trait anxiety. Trait anxiety significantly predicted fixational instability in the threat condition. An extreme tertile analysis revealed that fixation was less stable in the high anxiety group, especially under threat or in the absence of a stimulus. The effects of anxiety extend to perceptual and sensorimotor processes.

Across these districts, the youths reported that race was a central aspect of their identity and demonstrated varying levels of public regard. Racial discrimination was negatively associated with academic curiosity and persistence, but this effect was moderated by gender and racial identity.

Survey responses from 3505 adults in the United States indicate that younger age, a high level of education, positive affect for advanced driver assistance systems currently in use, and high self-rated early technology adoption tendency have significant influence on acceptance. Data reflecting time course and salience of media coverage on knowledge and attitudes, especially with high-profile events such as a fatal crash, is presented with implications around the need for balanced media reporting with more focus on the safety benefits.}

Prior studies documented the perceived benefits and concerns about this prospect, but did not examine the features in AV and support mechanisms that are desired by potential users. Method: An on-line survey was used to collect public opinions within the United States. In the survey, willingness to use AVs for this use case was asked twice to assess if participants changed their mind after being asked about concerns related to this prospect and importance of car features. A combination of statistical and machine-learning methods were used to profile individuals with high versus low post-willingness and to identify variables that differentiated the two groups. Results: Results indicated that respondents who were lower on their post-willingness to use AVs to transport children were more concerned about how AVs would protect children, how someone could harm the children inside, and whether there would be someone at the destination. In addition, they were less in favor of technology, older in age, and rated car features such as having a designated adult waiting at destination, a camera, and a microphone as relatively required (as opposed to optional). These results highlight potential users' needs and requirements as they think about AVs in the context of parent--children mobility practices. Practical Applications: Relevant stakeholders should develop deployment and implementation plans while taking into account ridership contexts and vulnerable road users who can benefit from enhanced mobility.},

Our results show that self-efficacy positively affects the perceived ease of use and intention to use, while the relative advantage affects perceived usefulness. Psychological ownership affects the intention to use but not the perceived usefulness. This implies that encouraging a consumer to form a psychological bond (i.e., psychological ownership) with an autonomous vehicle may be an effective strategy for promoting the use of autonomous vehicles.},

A U.S. sample of 394 adults answered questions about ICT use, pandemic-related reactions and actions, demographics, and psychosocial factors via an online survey. Using logistic regression, findings indicated that personality (extraversion and conscientiousness) and psychosocial (need to belong and perceived attachment to phone) factors, types of ICT as news source, and gender were associated with perceived importance of social connectedness. Neuroticism, time spent on ICT for social purposes, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were associated with future anxiety. In addition, using Mann--Whitney U test, people who rated higher on importance of social connectedness had higher ICT use, both in terms of types and time spent on ICT. Overall, results are consistent with the idea that technology is a coping tool during the pandemic and balanced use can lead to feelings of social connectedness and less future anxiety. Therefore, it is important for authorities to align their messaging and outreach with people's psychosocial, personality, and health considerations through ICT channels while empowering ICT users to be responsible for their interactions with the technology.},

To address this question, our study collected perceived benefits and concerns of AVs from a US convenience sample of parents whose children relied on them for mobility. We found that parents' intentions to travel in AV and their technology readiness as well as parent (sex, residence area) and child (age, restraint system) demographic profiles were important determinants of potential AV acceptance and impact. In addition, two groups of potential AV users emerged from the data: the curious and the practical. This study addresses a gap in the literature by assessing parents' perspectives on using AVs to transport children. The results have great potentials to guide the design of mobility features, safety evaluations, and implementation policies, as a decline in public interest in AVs has been recently documented.},

While the United States' withdrawal from Kabul was calamitous, the pessimism about America's role in Southeast Asia has been overstated.

Southeast Asian states deftly mixed their support for America's campaign in Afghanistan and the broader war on terror without being seen as too sympathetic, including, in some instances, condemnation of America's attacks on Islam. Regional governments balanced their domestic political interests with their foreign policy objectives. The abrupt Afghan withdrawal may instead have positive outcomes, as the United States boosted its courtship with countries of Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region through new security arrangements such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the Australian, U.K., and U.S. trilateral pact (AUKUS).}

Reliability analysis, technical statistics, paired sample t-test, correlation analysis, and path analysis were performed. Changes in the GRIT values of the participants were found to be greater than those of non-participants. It was also found that taekwondo ability, GRIT, and academic achievement had significant correlations with each other. Finally, it was found that the higher the taekwondo ability, the higher the academic achievement and the higher the GRIT. Moreover, the higher the GRIT, the higher the academic achievement. Taekwondo training increased the GRIT values of participants. In addition, the taekwondo ability had positive effects on GRIT and academic achievement.

The students also provided their actual academic performance and evaluated their perception of their academic performance as a success or a failure. The results of the path analysis showed that interest and perseverance were negatively associated with stress, and only perceived academic failure was positively associated with stress. These findings suggest that psychological appraisal and resources are more important antecedents of stress than objective negative events. Therefore, fostering students' psychological resilience may alleviate the stress experienced by associate degree students or college students in general.},

  abstract = {Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.}

  abstract = {Complacency refers to a type of automation use expressed as insufficient monitoring and verification of automated functions. Previous studies have attempted to identify the age-related factors that influence complacency during interaction with automation. However, little is known about the role of age-related differences in working memory capacity and its connection to complacent behaviors. The current study aims to examine whether working memory demand of an automated task and age-related differences in cognitive ability influence complacency. Higher degrees of automation (DOA) have been shown to reduce cognitive workload and may be used to manipulate working memory demand of a task. Thus, we hypothesize that a lower DOA (i.e. information acquisition stage with lower level) will demand more working memory than a higher DOA (i.e. decision selection stage with higher level) and that a lower DOA will result in a greater difference in complacency between age groups than a higher DOA.}

  abstract = {In this chapter, I review research involving remote human supervision of multiple unmanned vehicles (UVs) using command complexity as an organizing construct. Multi-UV tasks range from foraging, requiring little coordination among UVs, to formation following, in which UVs must function as a cohesive unit. Command complexity, the degree to which operator effort increases with the number of supervised UVs, is used to categorize human interaction with multiple UVs. For systems in which each UV requires the same form of attention (O(n)), effort increases linearly with the number of UVs. For systems in which the control of one UV is dependent upon another (O({$>$}n)), additional UVs impose greater than linear increases due to the expense of coordination. For other systems, an operator interacts with an autonomously coordinating group, and effort is unaffected by group size (O(1)). Studies of human/multi-UV interaction can be roughly grouped into O(n) supervision, involving one-to-one control of individual UVs, or O(1) commanding, in which higher-level commands are directed to a group. Research in O(n) command has centered on round-robin control, neglect tolerance, and attention switching. Approaches to O(1) command are divided into systems using autonomous path planning only, plan libraries, human-steered planners, and swarms. Each type of system has its advantages. Less complete work in scalable displays for multiple UVs is reviewed. Mixing levels of command is probably necessary to supervise multiple UVs performing realistic tasks. Research in O(n) control is mature and can provide quantitative and qualitative guidance for design. Interaction with planners and swarms is less mature but more critical to developing effective multi-UV systems capable of performing complex tasks.}

This experiment assessed the efficacy of visual and auditory representations of a system's confidence in its own abilities for supporting trust specificity, attention management and joint performance in the context of a UAV-supported target detection task. In contrast to earlier studies, neither visual nor auditory confidence information improved detection accuracy. Visual representations of confidence led to slower response times than auditory representations, likely due to resource competition with the visual target detection task. Finally, slower response times were observed when a UAV incorrectly detected a target. Results from this study can inform the design of visual and auditory representations of system confidence in human-machine teams with high attention demands.}

To support developing criteria for multi-UAV operator selection, the present study investigated the role of multiple individual difference factors in performance under different multi-UAV specific contexts. Specifically, we compared performance under fatigue using a high- and low-reliability automated aid. Accuracy on surveillance tasks, as well as reliance on automation were assessed. Video gaming expertise was associated with reduced stress and less reliance with a low-reliability automated aid. Distress was the most robust predictor of performance accuracy, but high distress was harmful only when reliability was low. Personality correlates of performance varied with both automation reliability and gender. Our findings suggest that multi-UAV operator selection should take into account the reliability of the automated systems.}

In addition, follower's psychological safety buffers the positive relationship between group relational conflict and followers' knowledge hiding.

Video gaming expertise correlated with performance on a demanding surveillance task component. Video gamers also placed more trust in the automation in demanding conditions and exhibited higher subjective task engagement and lower distress and worry.

Gamers may have a particular aptitude, and with gaming experience controlled, women show no disadvantage relative to men.}

However, little is known about the impact of mixed continuous and categorical observed variables on the performance of existing estimation methods. This study compares two popular estimation methods with robust corrections, robust maximum likelihood (MLR) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS), when mixed continuous and categorical observed data are analyzed, evaluating the behavior of DWLS and MLR estimates in both measurement and full structural equation models. Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to examine the performance of DWLS and MLR in estimating model parameters, standard errors, and chi-square statistics. Two population models, a correlated three-factor measurement model and a five-factor structural equation model, were tested in combination with 36 other experimental conditions characterized by the number of observed variables' categories (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), categorical observed distribution shape (symmetry and slight asymmetry), and sample size (200, 500, and 1000). Data generation and analysis were performed with Mplus 8. Results reveal that (1) DWLS yields more accurate factor loading estimates for categorical observed variables than MLR, whereas DWLS and MLR produce comparable factor loading estimates for continuous observed variables; (2) inter-factor correlations and structural paths are estimated equally well by DWLS and MLR in nearly all conditions; (3) robust standard errors of parameter estimates obtained by MLR are slightly more accurate than those produced by DWLS in almost every condition, but the superiority of MLR over DWLS is not clearly evident once a medium or large sample is used (i.e., n\,=\,500 or 1000); and (4) DWLS is systematically superior to MLR in controlling Type I error rates, but this superiority is attenuated with increasing sample size. The article concludes with a general discussion of the findings and some recommendations for practice and future research.}

The rationales for the observed patterns are investigated through semistructured interviews with managers employed by UK-based nonprofit organizations, financial services, and retail firms. The authors identify, among other things, differences in the nature of the ``selected'' social causes, the length and geographical scope of the social campaigns, and the (CRM) strategies used to implement them.

The related literature has shown that grittier learners persist in doing tasks, and developing their intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, the related literature has approved the effect of learners' language mindset on their grit. In other words, learners with a growth mindset are persistent, and they devote their time to their performance.

Background Decision aids typically benefit performance, but can provide incorrect advice due to contextual factors, creating the potential for automation disuse or misuse. Decision aids can reduce an operator's manual problem evaluation, and it can also be strategic for operators to minimize verifying automated advice in order to manage workload. Method Participants assigned the optimal unmanned vehicle to complete missions. A decision aid provided advice but was not always reliable. Two levels of decision aid transparency were manipulated between participants. The risk associated with each decision was manipulated using a financial incentive scheme. Participants could use a calculator to verify automated advice; however, this resulted in a financial penalty. Results For high- compared with low-risk decisions, participants were more likely to reject incorrect automated advice and were more likely to verify automation and reported higher workload. Increased transparency did not lead to more accurate decisions and did not impact workload but decreased automation verification and eliminated the increased decision time associated with high decision risk. Conclusion Increased automation transparency was beneficial in that it decreased automation verification and decreased decision time. The increased workload and automation verification for high-risk missions is not necessarily problematic given the improved automation correct rejection rate. Application The findings have potential application to the design of interfaces to improve human--automation teaming, and for anticipating the impact of decision risk on operator behavior.},

When automation malfunctions, trust is negatively affected. The development of increasingly complex multiple-component systems, or those with several autonomous elements, introduces even more ways for a system to err. One example is in smart home control systems where different subsystems may be controlled by different autonomous routines or rules. Multiple studies suggest that one error-prone component can lower user trust in the remaining components. This has been termed a ``pull down effect.'' Other research suggests that increasing the amount of information presented to the user can reduce the strength of the pull down effect by promoting heterogeneity of components. Although a majority of this research has been tested in the industrial domain, there exist certain types of information that are best suited for consumer automation (e.g., granting the automation a name and a voice). Providing this kind of information to the user may diminish the strength of the pull down effect. Thus, the current study will investigate the effectiveness of trust-preserving heterogeneity strategies in consumer multiple-component systems.}

The experiment required two groups of ten participants each to perform an automation-assisted target identification task with ``Automation Performance Feedback'' (APF) or ``Operator Performance Feedback'' (OPF). Four different scenarios differed with respect to the degree and duration of changes in system reliability. Findings indicate that APF was more effective for supporting timely adjustments of perceived system reliability, especially with large and long reliability changes.

To better understand the process of trust calibration, we propose eye tracking as an unobtrusive method for inferring trust levels in real time. Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle simulation, participants were exposed to varying levels of reliability of an automated target detection system. Eye movement data were captured and labeled as high or low trust based on subjective trust ratings. Feature extraction and raw eye movement data were compared as input for multiple classification modeling methods. Accuracy rates of 92\% and 80\%, respectively, were achieved with individual-level and group-level modeling, suggesting that eye tracking is a promising technique for tracing trust levels.}

The study was conducted at Central Luzon State University where 313 freshmen students participated. The correlational analysis found several surprising findings. First, both grit and college adjustment was not significantly related to freshmen students' academic performance. Happiness was the only significant predictor of academic performance. Second, the findings show that grit, academic adjustment, and happiness were significantly inter-correlated. The present investigation may suggest that the predictive ability of happiness on academic performance may be dependent on the influence of grit and college adjustment. This may further imply that the grittier the students, the more capable they are in adjusting with their academic life, the happier they become, and the higher academic performance they achieve. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.}

  abstract = {Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) are generally operated at low altitudes and within the earth boundary layer. This is a very dynamic environment with varying wind intensity and turbulence levels far greater than those experienced by traditional manned aircraft cruising at higher altitudes. Yet aerodynamic research on MAVs is often based on the assumption of steady aerodynamics. Little effort has been made to experimentally determine the validity of this assumption. In this paper, the effect of turbulence on the performance of a MAV is studied using flight testing in different wind conditions. Flight testing technique, data logging equipment and data reduction are explained. Additionally, a low cost technique for propeller performance measurement is presented. Results show that the flow around a MAV flying in windy conditions qualifies as highly unsteady, although the impact on its performance is surprisingly small for the kind of turbulence levels at which MAVs can be expected to operate. Accelerometer data from the flights reveals that if steady aerodynamic theory is assumed, increasing turbulence should have resulted in a measurable drag increase, thus indicating that the tested MAV to some extent passively manages to benefit from the turbulence.}

The main purpose of this study was to systematically review the relationships between the Big Five personality traits and various driving behaviors with different intentions (including risky, aggressive, and positive driving behaviors) through a meta-analysis. A total of 34 articles met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results showed that risky and aggressive driving behaviors were negatively associated with conscientiousness (r~=~--0.21; r~=~--0.26), agreeableness (r~=~--0.23; r~=~--0.37), and openness (r~=~--0.08; r~=~--0.07), positively associated with neuroticism (r~=~0.11; r~=~0.26), and nonsignificantly associated with extraversion (r~=~0.06; r~=~--0.06). Positive driving behaviors were positively associated with conscientiousness (r~=~0.30), agreeableness (r~=~0.32) and openness (r~=~0.20) but nonsignificantly associated with extraversion (r~=~0.08) and neuroticism (r~=~--0.10). In addition, the association between the Big Five personality traits and driving behaviors could be moderated by age, gender and type of personality measure. In conclusion, this study contributes to the literature by quantitatively synthesizing existing findings and reconciling previous debates on the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and driving behaviors. From a practical perspective, our findings provide valuable insights into driver selection and screening, policy development, and safety intervention design.},

While gritty individuals are more likely to engage in deliberate practice and maintain commitment in the face of setbacks, what remains unclear are the cognitive processes linking grit and academic performance.

The purpose of this study is to explore the mediational role that psychological capital (PsyCap) may play in the relationship between grit and student academic performance. Drawing from a sample (N = 176) of business students, the results indicate their PsyCap largely mediates the relationship between their grit and grade point averages. In other words, Academic PsyCap consisting of the psychological resources of hope, efficacy, resiliency, and optimism seem to help drive gritty students toward more successful academic performance.

Drawing from the dual-process model of narcissistic admiration and rivalry, we proposed that individuals higher in narcissism may contribute to more competitive and less cooperative conflict processes. We tracked over 100 project design teams from inception to dissolution, gathering data at three time points. We evaluated how team levels of narcissism (i.e., maximum team score, team mean, and team variance) related to latent team means of cooperative and competitive conflict processes. Team mean scores of narcissistic rivalry corresponded to less cooperative and more competitive team conflict processes as teams approached their final project deadline. Our results show how narcissistic rivalry (but not admiration) alters the types of team conflict processes that arise within groups, and is particularly consequential as teams approach major project deadlines.}

Background: Research has suggested certain biases against automation that influence human interaction with automation. We differentiated preconceived biases from post hoc biases and examined their effects on advice acceptance. Method: In Study 1 we examined operators' trust in and perceived reliability of humans versus automation of varying pedigree (expert vs. novice), based on written descriptions of these advisers prior to operators' interacting with these advisers. In Study 2 we examined participants' post hoc trust in, perceived reliability of, and dependence on these advisers after their objective experience of advisers' reliability (90\% vs. 70\%) in a luggage-screening task. Results: In Study 1 measures of perceived reliability indicated that automation was perceived as more reliable than humans across pedigrees. Measures of trust indicated that automated ?novices? were trusted more than human ?novices?; human ?experts? were trusted more than automated ?experts.? In Study 2, perceived reliability varied as a function of pedigree, whereas subjective trust was always higher for automation than for humans. Advice acceptance from novice automation was always higher than from novice humans. However, when advisers were 70\% reliable, errors generated by expert automation led to a drop in compliance/ reliance on expert automation relative to expert humans. Conclusion: Preconceived expectations of automation influence the use of these aids in actual tasks. Application: The results provide a reference point for deriving indices of ?optimal? user interaction with decision aids and for developing frameworks of trust in decision support systems.}

We empirically examine sales team intragroup conflict through a primary data collection of 195 distributor salespeople organized into 20 geographically dispersed teams. Our results largely support our hypotheses that there are nuanced effects across the loci of influences, such that in conflict-laden environments, having a performance orientation or perception of organizational distributive justice enhance job satisfaction, while a perception of organizational procedural justice decreases job satisfaction. Thus, we answer the call to better understand the role of conflict in marketing exchanges.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the reasoning as to why higher educational institutions lack the cyber gamification concept in their curricula. After an extensive review, there are many factors influencing why higher educational institutions lack an in demand cyber gamification program. Some of those factors include lack of financial resources, the high educational learning time investment and the negative perception of the program as a whole. This study concluded that cyber gamification teaches students highly sought out critical thinking skills as well as enforcing theoretical concepts. With minor adjustments to the mentioned barriers of inclusion, it was discovered that any higher educational institution can implement a cyber gamification program.},

Moreover, fewer efforts have been made to address this association in middle school students. Guided by an ecological framework, the current study aimed to integrate the conflicting findings into a coherent body of knowledge, paying particular attention to two research purposes: (a) to examine the association between parental control and three objective indicators of school adjustment (social competence, academic grades, and peer acceptance) and (b) to explore whether this association was moderated by individual characteristics of social identity and grit. A total of 120 Chinese middle school students (42.5\% females) aged between 13 and 15 years old were recruited for this study, and research data were gathered from multiple sources. To be specific, students were asked to complete a set of self-report questionnaires concerning parental control, social identity, and grit. Meanwhile, school-related social competence was rated by head teachers; academic grades were obtained from school records; and peer acceptance was assessed by sociometric nominations. The results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that parental control was negatively associated with academic grades. Moreover, when reporting higher levels of social identity, parental control was negatively related to social competence and peer acceptance for those students with lower levels of grit. Our findings suggest that parental control can dampen middle school students' academic performance, and low levels of grit can magnify the detrimental effect of parental control on social competence and peer acceptance in middle school students who regard themselves as closely connected to social groups.}

The present research examined the relationships between well-being---satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect---and using actively or passively various SNSs---Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok---during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs' architectures and users' motivations. Future research is required to go beyond methodological and statistical limitations and allow generalization. This study concludes that SNSs must be differentiated to truly understand how they shape human interactions.},

In bad weather (e.g., heavy rainfall, strong winds, storms, and fog), this risk almost doubles due to bad visibility as well as road conditions. If an accident happens, especially in bad weather, it is important to inform approaching vehicles about it. Otherwise, there might be another accident, i.e., a multiple-vehicle collision (MVC). If the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is not informed in a timely fashion about the incident, fatalities might increase because they do not receive immediate first aid. Detecting humans or animals would undoubtedly provide us with a better answer for reducing human fatalities in traffic accidents. In this research, an accident alert light and sound (AALS) system is proposed for auto accident detection and alerts with all types of vehicles. No changes are required in non-equipped vehicles (nEVs) and EVs because the system is installed on the roadside. The idea behind this research is to make smart roads (SRs) instead of equipping each vehicle with a separate system. Wireless communication is needed only when an accident is detected. This study is based on different sensors that are used to build SRs to detect accidents. Pre-saved locations are used to reduce the time needed to find the accident\&rsquo;s location without the help of a global positioning system (GPS). Additionally, the proposed framework for the AALS also reduces the risk of MVCs.},

  abstract = {Smartphones are particularly likely to elicit driver distraction with obvious negative repercussions on road safety. Recent selective attention models lead to expect that smartphones might be very effective in capturing attention due to their social reward history. Hence, individual differences in terms of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) -- i.e., of the apprehension of missing out on socially rewarding experiences -- should play an important role in driver distraction. This factor has already been associated with self-reported estimations of greater attention paid to smartphones while driving, but the potential link between FoMO and smartphone-induced distraction has never been tested empirically. Therefore, we conducted a preliminary study to investigate whether FoMO would modulate attentional capture by reward distractors displayed on a smartphone. First, participants performed a classical visual search task in which neutral stimuli (colored circles) were associated with high or low social reward outcomes. Then, they had to detect a pedestrian or a roe deer in driving scenes with various levels of fog density. The social reward stimuli were displayed as distractors on the screen of a smartphone embedded in the pictures. The results showed a significant three-way interaction between FoMO, social reward distraction, and task difficulty. More precisely, under attention-demanding conditions (i.e., high-fog density), individual FoMO scores predicted attentional capture by social reward distractors, with longer reaction times (RTs) for high rather than low social reward distractors. These results highlight the importance to consider reward history and FoMO when investigating smartphone-based distraction. Limitations are discussed, notably regarding our sample characteristics (i.e., mainly young females) that might hamper the generalization of our findings to the overall population. Future research directions are provided.}

  abstract = {The focus of this article is the supposed ``Gender Paradox,'' proposed by Labov(1990,2001), which suggests that women are both sometimes conservative and sometimes innovative in terms of linguistic variation and change. Here we explore the paradox from two perspectives: we in vestigate both its applicability to multilingual as opposed to multidialectal communities as well as question whether the paradox is methodological or real. Although much sociolinguistic research on the paradox has been on macro studies of men versus women in monolingual multidialectal communities, this paper presents quantitative analyses supplemented by in-depth ethnographic observation and data collection in a multilingual Japanese-Palauan community of the Western Pacific. What is more, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the ``conservatism'' and ``innovation'' of women in the community under scrutiny is represented by the use of the very same language---Japanese. For older Japanese-Palauan women, the greater use of Japanese represents adherence to their heritage language. Among younger Japanese-Palauan women(most of whom are bilingual in Palauan and English), however, the use of Japanese represents a change to wards a language highly valued in the economy as essential for the promotion of tourism and trade. Since our results demonstrate that the effects of gender on language behavior may appear in differences within sex groupings, we conclude that the paradox is methodological, rather than real, and is a result of the distillling of gender down to binary male-female categories of analysis, rather than investigating the complexity of gender more qualitatively. Our ethnographic analysis of multilingual data from Palau presented here demonstrates that function as well as form are important in understanding seemingly paradoxical examples of language shift, as well as highlighting the need both for further research on the effects of gender in multilingual communities and the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis in studies of language change.}

  abstract = {Objective: This article advocates multidimensional assessment of task stress in human factors and reviews the use of the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ) for evaluation of systems and operators. Background: Contemporary stress research has progressed from an exclusive focus on environmental stressors to transactional perspectives on the stress process. Performance impacts of stress reflect the operator's dynamic attempts to understand and cope with task demands. Multidimensional stress assessments are necessary to gauge the different forms of system-operator interaction. Method: This review discusses the theoretical and practical use of the DSSQ in evaluating multidimensional patterns of stress response. It presents psychometric evidence for the multidimensional perspective and illustrative profiles of subjective state response to task stressors and environments. Evidence is also presented on stress state correlations with related variables, including personality, stress process measures, psychophysiological response, and objective task performance. Results: Evidence supports the validity of the DSSQ as a task stress measure. Studies of various simulated environments show that different tasks elicit different profiles of stress state response. Operator characteristics such as resilience predict individual differences in state response to stressors. Structural equation modeling may be used to understand performance impacts of stress states. Conclusion: Multidimensional assessment affords insight into the stress process in a variety of human factors contexts. Integrating subjective and psychophysiological assessment is a priority for future research. Application: Stress state measurement contributes to evaluating system design, countermeasures to stress and fatigue, and performance vulnerabilities. It may also support personnel selection and diagnostic monitoring of operators.},

This situation has led to definitional ambiguity and variation, which limits the development of innovation as a scientific construct. We present a conceptualization of innovation and classification of innovations through exploratory factor analysis with data collected from chiefs of police. Our findings suggest that chiefs weigh newness or novelty only partially when judging innovativeness. Chiefs also appear to classify innovativeness in terms of the utility that innovations provide to organizational operations. Our findings suggest a disconnect between prior literature and practitioners in how innovation is viewed, which hampers its conceptual development in the literature.}

This research incorporates grit scale by Angela Duckworth, subjective happiness scale by Lyubomirsky and satisfaction with life scale by Diener. Our study concluded that the level of grit, happiness and life satisfaction are positively correlated. Data was analyzed by applying SPSS Pearson's correlation test. This research will benefit people and give them motivation that one doesn't need to be academically strong throughout to become successful, since consistency and effort also play a major part in success. This can be applied to individuals in schools and organizations. In schools and academic institutions teachers can help students to build grit and organizations can apply this on their employees. It will also motivate students, since success can increase the chances of being happy and satisfied from life.}

  abstract = {Objectives. To determine whether the substantial short-term declines in drivers' use of hand-held phones achieved in the District of Columbia (DC) were sustained 1 year after a ban. Methods. Drivers' daytime hand-held cell phone use was observed in DC and nearby areas of Virginia and Maryland, states without bans. Observations were conducted several months before the ban, shortly after, and 1 year later. The number of vehicles observed in all three surveys combined was 51,945 in DC, 36,796 in Maryland, and 43,033 in Virginia. Results. The rate of talking on hand-held phones declined significantly from 6.1 percent before the law to 3.5 percent shortly after; when measured 1 year later, use was 4.0 percent, still significantly lower than baseline. Based on increases in rates of talking on hand-held phones in Maryland and Virginia, longer-term phone use in DC was estimated to be 53 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. Declines in DC were identified for drivers of vehicles registered in all three jurisdictions. Conclusions. In DC, there was an initial decline of about 50 percent in drivers talking on hand-held cell phones following a ban, and this decline was sustained about 1 year later. After a similar ban in New York, there was an initial decline in phone use comparable with the initial decline in DC, but the decline a year after the New York ban took full effect was only about 21 percent and not statistically significant. The potential difference in sustained effectiveness for the DC ban may reflect tougher enforcement in DC. Even if full compliance with hand-held phone bans can be achieved, the risks from drivers' use of hands-free phones will remain.},

  abstract = {Methods: The percentage of drivers talking on handheld cell phones was measured over time with daytime observation surveys in the jurisdictions with bans and comparison jurisdictions without bans. Trends were modeled using Poisson regression to estimate differences between actual rates and rates that would have been expected without a ban. Results: The D.C. ban immediately lowered the percentage of drivers talking on handheld cell phones by 41 percent. Nearly 5 years later, the rate was 43 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. Use in Connecticut declined 76 percent immediately after the ban; 31/2 years later, use was 65 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. In New York, use declined 47 percent immediately after the ban; 7 years later, use was 24 percent lower than expected without the ban. Fifteen months after the laws took effect, compliance in New York was lower than in D.C., and the difference appeared due to more intensive enforcement in D.C. However, this linkage is no longer clear because enforcement in New York picked up such that 2008 levels of enforcement appeared comparable in D.C. and New York, whereas enforcement in Connecticut lagged behind. In all three jurisdictions, the chance that a violator would receive a citation was low, and there were no publicized targeted enforcement campaigns. Conclusions: Jurisdictional bans have reduced handheld phone use and appear capable of maintaining reductions for the long term. However, it is unknown whether overall phone use is lower because many drivers may have switched to hands-free devices. Further research is needed to determine whether reduced handheld cell phone use has reduced crashes.},

Remotely controlled ground, aerial, sea-surface, and underwater robotic vehicles are serving as tools to safely extend the sensory and psychomotor capabilities of humans to remote environments while keeping humans safe. More importantly, with the ever-increasing technological sophistication in their design and capabilities, robots are becoming more than mere tools. They now can be seen as quasi--team members whose tasks and behaviors must be integrated with the task requirements and expectations of their human teammates. Yet without the necessary research base to inform design, sizeable investments will likely be made into developing robotic systems that are ineffective or, at best, not optimal. Toward this end, the goal of this two-part special issue is to present examples of the latest research on human-robot interaction that demonstrate how theories and empirical findings can be translated into practical, useful guidance for improving human-robot team performance across various domains.}

  abstract = {Background Rising rates of overweight children have focused attention on walking and biking to school as a means to increase children's physical activity levels. Despite this attention, there has been little documentation of trends in school travel over the past 30 years or analysis of what has caused the changes in mode choice for school trips. Methods This article analyzes data from the 1969, 1977, 1983, 1990, 1995, and 2001 National Personal Transportation Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation to document the proportion of students actively commuting to school in aggregate and by subgroups and analyze the relative influence of trip, child, and household characteristics across survey years. All analyses were done in 2006. Results The National Personal Transportation Survey data show that in 1969, 40.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]=37.9--43.5) of students walked or biked to school; by 2001, the proportion was 12.9\% (95\% CI=11.8--13.9). Distance to school has increased over time and may account for half of the decline in active transportation to school. It also has the strongest influence on the decision to walk or bike across survey years. Conclusions Declining rates of active transportation among school travelers represents a worrisome loss of physical activity. Policymakers should continue to support programs designed to encourage children to walk to school such as Safe Routes to School and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's KidsWalk. In addition, officials need to design policies that encourage schools to be placed within neighborhoods to ensure that the distance to school is not beyond an acceptable walking distance.}

Background: Networked systems such as multi--unmanned air vehicle (UAV) supervision have complex properties that make prediction of human-system performance difficult. Automated decision aid can provide valuable information to operators, individual abilities can limit or facilitate team performance, and team communication patterns can alter how effectively individuals work together. We hypothesized that reliable automation, higher working memory capacity, and increased communication rates of task-relevant information would offset performance decrements attributed to high task load. Method: Two-person teams performed a simulated air defense task with two levels of task load and three levels of automated aid reliability. Teams communicated and received decision aid messages via chat window text messages. Results: Task Load {\texttimes} Automation effects were significant across all performance measures. Reliable automation limited the decline in team performance with increasing task load. Average team spatial working memory was a stronger predictor than other measures of team working memory. Frequency of team rapport and enemy location communications positively related to team performance, and word count was negatively related to team performance. Conclusion: Reliable decision aiding mitigated team performance decline during increased task load during multi-UAV supervisory control. Team spatial working memory, communication of spatial information, and team rapport predicted team success. Application: An automated decision aid can improve team performance under high task load. Assessment of spatial working memory and the communication of task-relevant information can help in operator and team selection in supervisory control systems.},

Specifically, team situation awareness (TSA) and team conflict are examined in human?machine teams. There is a significant need to identify how TSA and team conflict occur during human?machine teaming, in addition to how they impact each other. In this work, we present an experiment aimed at understanding TSA and team conflict in the context of human?machine teaming in a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Three conditions were tested: (1) control: teams consisted of all humans; (2) synthetic: teams consisted of the pilot role being occupied by a computational agent based on ACT-R architecture that employed AI capabilities, with all other team roles being humans; and (3) experimenter: an experimenter playing the role of the pilot as a highly effective computational agent, with the other roles being humans. The results indicate that TSA improved over time in synthetic teams, improved and then stabilized over time in experimenter teams, and did not improve in control teams. In addition, results show that control teams had the most team conflict. Finally, in the control condition, team conflict negatively impacts TSA.}

  abstract = {Model fit assessment is a central component of evaluating confirmatory factor analysis models and the validity of psychological assessments. Fit indices remain popular and researchers often judge fit with fixed cutoffs derived by Hu and Bentler (1999). Despite their overwhelming popularity, methodological studies have cautioned against fixed cutoffs, noting that the meaning of fit indices varies based on a complex interaction of model characteristics like factor reliability, number of items, and number of factors. Criticism of fixed cutoffs stems primarily from the fact that they were derived from one specific confirmatory factor analysis model and lack generalizability. To address this, we propose a simulation-based method called dynamic fit index cutoffs such that derivation of cutoffs is adaptively tailored to the specific model and data characteristics being evaluated. Unlike previously proposed simulation-based techniques, our method removes existing barriers to implementation by providing an open-source, Web based Shiny software application that automates the entire process so that users neither need to manually write any software code nor be knowledgeable about foundations of Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, we extend fit index cutoff derivations to include sets of cutoffs for multiple levels of misspecification. In doing so, fit indices can more closely resemble their originally intended purpose as effect sizes quantifying misfit rather than improperly functioning as ad hoc hypothesis tests. We also provide an approach specifically designed for the nuances of 1-factor models, which have received surprisingly little attention in the literature despite frequent substantive interests in unidimensionality.

  abstract = {Objective In this review, we investigate the relationship between agent transparency, Situation Awareness, mental workload, and operator performance for safety critical domains. Background The advancement of highly sophisticated automation across safety critical domains poses a challenge for effective human oversight. Automation transparency is a design principle that could support humans by making the automation's inner workings observable (i.e., ``seeing-into''). However, experimental support for this has not been systematically documented to date. Method Based on the PRISMA method, a broad and systematic search of the literature was performed focusing on identifying empirical research investigating the effect of transparency on central Human Factors variables. Results Our final sample consisted of 17 experimental studies that investigated transparency in a controlled setting. The studies typically employed three human-automation interaction types: responding to agent-generated proposals, supervisory control of agents, and monitoring only. There is an overall trend in the data pointing towards a beneficial effect of transparency. However, the data reveals variations in Situation Awareness, mental workload, and operator performance for specific tasks, agent-types, and level of integration of transparency information in primary task displays. Conclusion Our data suggests a promising effect of automation transparency on Situation Awareness and operator performance, without the cost of added mental workload, for instances where humans respond to agent-generated proposals and where humans have a supervisory role. Application Strategies to improve human performance when interacting with intelligent agents should focus on allowing humans to see into its information processing stages, considering the integration of information in existing Human Machine Interface solutions.},

  abstract = {Researchers often turn to post hoc statistical techniques to identify common method variance (CMV) in same source data and one viable option is to use a marker variable. The choice of marker variable is important, yet these variables are difficult to find, primarily because they must be theoretically unrelated to study variables but measured in the same way (e.g., perceptual; on a Likert scale). This manuscript uses scale development best practices to create a marker variable---attitude toward the color blue---that can be applied in a wide variety of social science research. Scale reliability and validity are addressed, discriminant validity with other measures that detect CMV is tested, and the Confirmatory Factor Analysis Marker Technique is applied with this scale. An experiment designed to analyze the effect of the placement of the scale in surveys is reported. Recommendations to researchers for use of this new scale to detect CMV are provided.}

  abstract = {Objective: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible supervisory control via delegation to automation. Background: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. Method: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to ``adaptable'') automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a ``level of automation'' as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook{\textregistered} is described. Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team's ``playbook.'' Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. Conclusion: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. Application: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example for uninhabited air vehicle mission planning.},

This panel will review concepts and uses of Levels of Automation schemas and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses.

One of the most prevalent risky mobile phone use behaviours is texting while driving. Attempts to explain texting while driving suggest cognitive variables and personality characteristics are key factors. This study explored relationships between trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging, trait mindfulness, and texting while driving. One hundred and seventy participants comprising Australian undergraduate psychology students and members of the public completed an online survey measuring trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging behaviour, trait mindfulness, and frequency of texting while driving. It was found that habitual texting behaviour mediated the relationship between trait self-regulation and frequency of texting while driving. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the relationship between habit and texting while driving, such that habitual texting was significantly, positively related to texting while driving, but only for individuals with low to moderate trait mindfulness. These results suggest personality constructs related to attention, awareness, and control of behaviour play a significant role in counteracting the association that habitual texting behaviour has with the frequency of texting while driving. As these traits are considered malleable, this association may be applicable in future development of intervention programs aimed at increasing control over mobile phone use and reducing the frequency with which people text while driving.},

Accordingly, in this paper, we identify current research on psychological traits and individual differences among computer system users that explain vulnerabilities to cyber security attacks and crimes. Our review shows that computer system users possess different cognitive capabilities which determine their ability to counter information security threats. We identify gaps in the existing research and provide possible psychological methods to help computer system users comply with security policies and thus increase network and information security.}

  abstract = {With the widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), understanding the behavior of intelligent agents and robots is crucial to guarantee successful human-agent collaboration since it is not straightforward for humans to understand an agent's state of mind. Recent empirical studies have confirmed that explaining a system's behavior to human users fosters the latter's acceptance of the system. However, providing overwhelming or unnecessary information may also confuse the users and cause failure. For these reasons, parsimony has been outlined as one of the key features allowing successful human-agent interaction with parsimonious explanation defined as the simplest explanation (i.e. least complex) that describes the situation adequately (i.e. descriptive adequacy). While parsimony is receiving growing attention in the literature, most of the works are carried out on the conceptual front. This paper proposes a mechanism for parsimonious eXplainable AI (XAI). In particular, it introduces the process of explanation formulation and proposes HAExA, a human-agent explainability architecture allowing to make it operational for remote robots. To provide parsimonious explanations, HAExA relies on both contrastive explanations and explanation filtering. To evaluate the proposed architecture, several research hypotheses are investigated in an empirical user study that relies on well-established XAI metrics to estimate how trustworthy and satisfactory the explanations provided by HAExA are. The results are analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistical testing.},

Methods This review details the findings from a systematic review of peer reviewed literature identified via keyword searches in ISI Web of Science, Engineering Village Compendex, IEEE Explore, PsycINFO, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) online, ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses, and Google Scholar. Proceeding articles, peer reviewed journals, cited grey literature, and government technical reports relevant to temporal variability in human performance were identified and used in this review. Both statistical and contents analysis were conducted in this paper. Results Results suggest that the current state of research in human temporal variability is evolving but still has shortcomings in terms of integrating all aspects of interplay between the physical and cognitive components of human response. In light of this, research supporting the sustained development and use of refined cognitive-physical models is gaining momentum and sensible efforts to use task analysis tools that provide integration of both the cognitive and physical components of human response are underway. Conclusions This article identifies that although considerable advancements have been made in understanding the temporal variability of human performance, substantial research regarding the factors affecting it, their impacts, and the practical implications are still required. Originality/value This study is unique in both the breadth and range of literature considered regarding the factors affecting temporal variability in human performance as well as their implications. Successful consideration of these elements in human-centered complex adaptive systems establishes mechanisms for efficient and effective manpower and risk mitigation planning.},

A brief (24-item) measurement scale was created to assess acceptance of self-driving cars. Before completing the scale, participants were randomly assigned to read short vignettes that featured either a realistic or an idealistic description of a friend's experiences during the first six months of owning a self-driving car. A small but significant effect showed that reading an idealized portrayal in the vignette resulted in higher acceptance of self-driving cars. Potential factors affecting user acceptance of self-driving cars are discussed.

Instead, compatibility with current travel was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention to use automated shuttles. It was further found that individuals who are willing to share rides in an automated shuttle with fellow travelers (i.e., automated shuttle sharing) and who trust automated shuttles (i.e., trust) are more likely to intend to use automated shuttles (i.e., behavioural intention). The highest mean rating was obtained for believing that automated shuttles are easy to use, while the lowest mean rating was obtained for feeling safe inside the automated shuttle without any type of supervision. The analysis revealed a preference for the supervision of the automated shuttle via an external control room to the supervision by a human steward onboard. We recommend future research to investigate the hypothesis that compatibility could serve as an even stronger predictor of the behavioural intention to use automated shuttles in public transport than performance expectancy.},

Over the past years, team conflict has increasingly been viewed as a major factor that can cause the failure of a software project. Conflict must be properly managed in the best interest of the project's stakeholders. This research uses team conflict dynamics model to analyse different conflict types and team conflict profiles to produce a framework that can improve project success in software development. An eight stage framework was devised and was tested. From the data gathered it was found that the framework was successful. This framework can be studied by individuals, taught or applied by a mediator and also another benefit is that individuals are encouraged to express themselves and integrate emotional intelligence.},

  abstract = {A crisis discourse has developed within the health and physical activity literature that paints a disparaging picture about the decline of children's participation in active play and independent mobility. Fear as a moderator of children's mobility, in this case focused on independent active school travel (IAST), remains a poorly understood construct. Within the popular press and academic literature, middle class parents have been characterised as overly anxious towards culturally reinforced dangers whilst being ignorant of the benefits of IAST during childhood. Fear of strangers, dangers and risk-taking are portrayed as nebulous and irrational anxiety states that are contributing to another great fear, a fear that our children are getting fat. The study draws upon Tudor's, (2003), parameters of fear framework to explore parent negotiations of fear and risk associated with IAST. In depth individual and focus group interviews with parents (N=24) provide insight into meanings, rules and customs that govern the way in which fear is experienced and expressed within a middle class white suburb in Australia. Far from being irrational, and operating purely from drivers at a cultural level, parents were aware of the consequences of their decisions on a range of outcomes. Parents could articulate their own anxieties and in many cases the rational probabilities of anything bad happening. Fear was being constructed through complex relations, negotiated individually and collectively within a specific cultural and environmental context. In the process of their decision-making, there remained a constant negotiation between a desire to allow their child independence and the question `what if?' Those seeking to mediate increased opportunities for children's IAST are encouraged to remove the rational/irrational focus that was redundant for parents in this study, and consider shifting the message toward the positive side of what is a highly contested decision making space for parents.},

  abstract = {The development of a modern electric power grid has triggered the need for large-scale monitoring and communication in smart grids for efficient grid automation. This has led to the development of smart grids, which utilize cognitive radio sensor networks, which are combinations of cognitive radios and wireless sensor networks. Cognitive radio sensor networks can overcome spectrum limitations and interference challenges. The implementation of dense cognitive radio sensor networks, based on the specific topology of smart grids, is one of the critical issues for guaranteed quality of service through a communication network. In this article, various topologies of ZigBee cognitive radio sensor networks are investigated. Suitable topologies with energy-efficient spectrum-aware algorithms of ZigBee cognitive radio sensor networks in smart grids are proposed. The performance of the proposed ZigBee cognitive radio sensor network model with its control algorithms is analyzed and compared with existing ZigBee sensor network topologies within the smart grid environment. The quality of service metrics used for evaluating the performance are the end-to-end delay, bit error rate, and energy consumption. The simulation results confirm that the proposed topology model is preferable for sensor network deployment in smart grids based on reduced bit error rate, end-to-end delay (latency), and energy consumption. Smart grid applications require prompt, reliable, and efficient communication with low latency. Hence, the proposed topology model supports heterogeneous cognitive radio sensor networks and guarantees network connectivity with spectrum-awareness. Hence, it is suitable for efficient grid automation in cognitive radio sensor network--based smart grids. The traditional model lacks these capability features.}

Computer simulations of aerodynamic flows are commonly used in advanced aircraft designing. Numerous data on the characteristics of an airplane can be obtained from tunnel tests of geometrically scaled models. To get complete characteristics from both stable and unstable flight conditions, dynamically scaled models are constructed and applied in static or dynamic tests. The dynamically similar scaled model is, in fact, a reduced model of the real airplane which has specific qualities similar to qualities of a real aircraft and these relations are strictly defined with specific similarity numbers (factors). The article presents methodology for determining scale factors in relation to geometric, aerodynamic, and structural properties (mass, stiffness) of the aircraft. The methodology will be presented on the example of Tu-154 aircraft that crashed in April 2010 with the President of the Republic of Poland and many military and government officials on board. Dynamically similar downscaled model was designed in Faculty of Mechatronics and Aerospace of the Military University of Technology (FMA MUT, Warsaw, Poland) and is still being developed in the framework of ongoing research project. This paper presents only general assumptions taken for the process and the current stage of successively developed model.}

Within a multi-task simulation consisting of a monitoring task and two other concurrent tasks, participants were assigned to one of five groups. In the manual control group none of the tasks was supported by an alarm system, whereas the four experimental groups were supported in the monitoring task by a miss-prone alarm system differing in reliability, i.e. 68.75\%, 75\%, 87.5\%, 93.75\%. Compared to the manual control group, all experimental groups benefited from the support by alarms, with best performance for the highest reliability condition. However, for the lowest reliability group the benefit was associated with an increased attentional effort, a more demanding attention allocation strategy, and a declined relative performance in a concurrent task. Results are discussed in the context of recent automation research.},

  abstract = {Objective: Self-control and grit have become two of the most important variables that explain success in different aspects of people's daily life (Duckworth and Gross, 2014). Self-control promotes delayed gratification and directly influences thoughts, emotions, and impulses. On the other hand, grit enhances the achievement of goals through perseverance even before extreme external circumstances. Since both constructs are related, examining them together is compelling, as long as the different nuances that characterize each are taken into account. Two structural equation models (SEM) were conducted to observe the effect of self-control and grit on a more specific indicator of academic success (academic self-efficacy) and a more general indicator of school experience (satisfaction with school). Methods: The first model comprises 5,681 primary students (M = 9.05; SD = 0.79), and the second 10,017 secondary students (M = 14.20; SD = 1.04) from Lima, Peru. In both models, the influence of grit and self-control on school satisfaction was observed when taking self-efficacy as a mediator variable. Results: The results show that grit and self-control have strong associations in both primary and secondary students. When estimating the covariance of both constructs, grit is related with academic-self efficacy at both educational stages, but only to satisfaction with school in secondary students. On the contrary, self-control shows a significant relationship with school satisfaction only in primary education. In turn, self-efficacy shows a mediating effect between grit and school satisfaction. After calculating the invariance of the models, differences are observed by gender in the relationships between variables. Conclusion: The results indicate that both constructs are strongly interrelated. Regarding the associations with the indicators of academic success, a need for timely interventions specific to each educational stage is observed.}

This type of situation allows examining higher workloads and task demands and it is in such conditions that it was hypothesized that the addition of tactile alerts will be beneficial. Results of an experiment conducted on 22 reserve soldier participants reveal that there are advantages to the use of the combined visual+tactile alert interface. However, they also raise concerns as to the ability of soldiers to attend to a display device and to their immediate environment at the same time and call for further research on the utilization of tactile alerts.}

The data, including individual self-reports and judges' ratings of team performance, were aggregated to the team-level using both composition (mean) and compilation (skewness) approaches. Findings The findings indicate that mean-levels of negative affectivity were associated with decreased psychological safety. The use of skewed conscientiousness counterintuitively suggests too many highly conscientious members can also be detrimental to psychological safety. Psychological safety influences team potency and ultimately performance. Originality/value The results of this study highlight that the aggregation approach used is important. For example, the use of skewed (but not mean-level) conscientiousness brought an undetected and counterintuitive relationship to light. Future research should use compilation approaches in addition to composition approaches.}

We describe findings on kinds and frequencies of checking behaviors in three studies. We found that checking habits occasionally spur users to do other things with the device and may increase usage overall. Data from a controlled field experiment show that checking behaviors emerge and are reinforced by informational ``rewards'' that are very quickly accessible. Qualitative data suggest that although repetitive habitual use is frequent, it is experienced more as an annoyance than an addiction. We conclude that supporting habit-formation is an opportunity for making smartphones more ``personal'' and ``pervasive.''},

The results showed that young males and females largely differed in the factors associated with their phone use in the car and risky driving. For example, a range of factors was related to males' phone use in the car (including boredom proneness and social connectedness), but only phone activity frequency uniquely and significantly predicted females' phone use in the car. The study results indicate that males' and females' phone use in the car should be considered separately, as they appear to be influenced by different precursors.

Didactic coursework GPA was used as a surrogate for academic success. Information about pursuit and attainment of a postgraduate training position was also documented and used in the analyses. Results. There was no significant correlation between Grit-S scores and variables related to academic success. However, students were more likely to pursue postgraduate training with higher academic success and higher Grit-S. Lastly, students with higher Grit-S were also more likely to obtain a postgraduate training position. Conclusion. Grit-S scores correlated with the pursuit and successful attainment of postgraduate training, but not with academic success during the didactic years of a PharmD program.}

Smartphone apps, given accessibility in the time of physical distancing, were widely used for tracking, tracing and educating the public about COVID-19. Despite limitations, such as concerns around data privacy, data security, digital health illiteracy and structural inequities, there is ample evidence that apps are beneficial for understanding outbreak epidemiology, individual screening and contact tracing. While there were successes and failures in each category, outbreak epidemiology and individual screening were substantially enhanced by the reach of smartphone apps and accessory wearables.

Because the nature of group projects highlights collaborative work, it is common for students to experience conflict among team members for various reasons, thereby hindering their learning and motivation to participate in the project. Such negative motivational consequences of what we termed intragroup conflict may be mitigated by group members' responses to the conflict. One such response may be a sense of compassion, either directed toward others or toward the self. This study explored the role of compassion (self-compassion and compassion to others) in college students' motivational and emotional experiences when intragroup conflict among team members was perceived. From an initial model of students' various motivational goals for the group project, measures of intragroup conflict (in a second step) and of self-compassion and compassion to others (in a third step) were added to predict students' project commitment and emotions. Three hierarchical multiple regressions showed that goals explained a significant amount of variance in project commitment and positive and negative emotions. A measure of conflict improved predictions significantly as did adding measures of self-compassion and compassion to others. The final model for project commitment showed that significant contributors were intragroup conflict (in a negative direction) and compassion to others (positive direction). Positive emotions were predicted only by self-compassion, whereas negative emotions were predicted by intragroup conflict (positively), self-compassion (negatively), and compassion to others (negatively).},

In autoregressive cross-lagged models, grit predicted rank-order increases in growth mindset and growth mindset predicted rank-order increases in grit. These findings suggest that during adolescence, grit and growth mindset are distinct but mutually reinforcing.},

The goal of the current study was to understand how perceptions of school culture influence the development of grit in middle school students. We conducted a year-long, prospective, longitudinal study (N\,=\,1277) examining grit, perceived goal structures (mastery vs. performance), and academic achievement. In cross-sectional analyses, we found that students who perceived their schools as more mastery goal-oriented were grittier and earned higher report card grades. In contrast, students who perceived their schools as more performance goal-oriented were less gritty and earned lower report card grades. In longitudinal analyses, changes in perceived mastery school goal structure predicted changes in grit over the school year, which in turn predicted changes in grades. Changes in perceived performance school goal structure, in contrast, did not reliably predict changes in grit. These findings suggest that school environments that emphasize the value of learning for learning's sake may encourage children to sustain interest in and effort toward long-term goals.}

Method Participants included 120 drivers (48 teens, 72 older adults) who completed the 45-item Big Five Personality questionnaire assessing self-reported personality factors and the Questionnaire Assessing Distracted Driving (QUADD) assessing the frequency of distracted driving behaviors. Associations for all five personality traits with each outcome (e.g., number of times texting on the phone, talking on the phone, and interacting with the phone while driving) were analyzed separately for teens and older adults using negative binomial or Poisson regressions that controlled for age, gender and education. Results In teens, higher levels of openness and conscientiousness were predictive of greater reported texting frequency and interacting with a phone while driving, while lower levels of agreeableness was predictive of fewer reported instances of texting and interacting with a phone while driving. In older adults, greater extraversion was predictive of greater reported talking on and interacting with a phone while driving. Other personality factors were not significantly associated with distracted driving behaviors. Conclusions Personality traits may be important predictors of distracted driving behaviors, though specific traits associated with distracted driving may vary across age groups. The relationship between personality and distracted driving behaviors provides a unique opportunity to target drivers who are more likely to engage in distracted driving behavior, thereby increasing the effectiveness of educational campaigns and improving driving safety.},

Regression analysis has shown that grit has no incremental validity to personality and emotional intelligence in predicting any of the work performance criteria (task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors and counterproductive work behaviors).

The search identified 45 experiments from 38 articles and 17 unique proposed mediators that were categorized into affective/subjective (n = 6), cognitive (n = 7) and motivational mechanisms (n = 4). Empirical support was accrued for mediators such as anxiety, negative thinking, and mind-wandering, which are suggested to co-opt working memory resources under stereotype threat. Other research points to the assertion that stereotype threatened individuals may be motivated to disconfirm negative stereotypes, which can have a paradoxical effect of hampering performance. However, stereotype threat appears to affect diverse social groups in different ways, with no one mediator providing unequivocal empirical support. Underpinned by the multi-threat framework, the discussion postulates that different forms of stereotype threat may be mediated by distinct mechanisms.}

Previous work showed that first-year African American medical students whose self-concept was highly linked to their race (high racial identity centrality) were at greater risk for poor well-being. The current study extends this work by examining (a) whether the psychological impact of racial discrimination on well-being depends on African American medical students' racial identity centrality and (b) whether this process is explained by how accepted students feel in medical school. This study used baseline data from the Medical Student Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation (CHANGE) Study, a large national longitudinal cohort study of 4732 medical students at 49 medical schools in the USA (n~=~243). Regression analyses were conducted to test whether medical student acceptance mediated an interactive effect of discrimination and racial identity centrality on self-esteem and well-being. Both racial identity centrality and everyday discrimination were associated with negative outcomes for first-year African American medical students. Among participants who experienced higher, but not lower, levels of everyday discrimination, racial identity centrality was associated with negative outcomes. When everyday discrimination was high, but not low, racial identity was negatively related to perceived acceptance in medical school, and this in turn was related to increased negative outcomes. Our results suggest that discrimination may be particularly harmful for African American students who perceive their race to be central to their personal identity. Additionally, our findings speak to the need for institutional change that includes commitment and action towards inclusivity and the elimination of structural racism.}

It examines the process of production of two different maps, the maps produced by San Diego County and a popular Google My Map created by local media and academic institutions, in order to explore how an unfolding disaster comes to be understood. This article argues that the interplay between different technological and human entities to produce each map in turn produced different spaces of disaster in ways that challenged priorities of disaster preparedness and response. Specifically, the different mapping practices in 2007 produced different relationships to temporality, boundaries and responsibility, making different aspects of the disaster visible while constructing different threats and definitions of danger. They juxtaposed representational and relational knowledge as well as the value of prevention and demonstration. This article draws on data collected through textual analysis of government and scientific documents as well as interviews and observations of key actors, their mapping practices, and socio-technological networks.}

Part of this challenge is due to the presence of qualifiers of information, or meta-information (e.g., staleness, uncertainty, source), that alter a person's information processing, situational awareness, and decision-making. We investigated the influence of meta-information on decision-making in a Military Intelligence Operations (IO) environment using Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) techniques. We performed a CTA on IO tasks surrounding the use of smart sensor webs, a relatively new technology that can be used for a variety of IO purposes. Our analysis addressed information management tasks and tactical decision-making tasks using sensor webs. We discovered that a variety of types of meta-information significantly impacted decision-making, and that the influence of meta-information was both context- and task- sensitive. In this paper, we present the results of the CTA and discuss the implications for the development of decision-aiding systems, including the design of constituent displays, interfaces, and automated systems.}

A longitudinal design was used, and the data were analysed using analysis of variance, factor analysis, and structural equations models. Adolescents' academic grit and school achievement fall between ages of 10 and 14. Adolescents with higher levels of grit had higher academic achievement. The two constructs are correlated, which is why interventions aimed at improving academic grit could be important in improving school performance.}

  abstract = {Working with artificial agents is a challenging endeavor, often imposing high levels of workload on human operators who work within these socio-technical systems. We seek to understand these workload demands through examining the literature in major content areas of human--robot interaction. As research on HRI continues to explore a host of issues with operator workload, there is a need to synthesize the extant literature to determine its current state and to guide future research. Within HRI socio-technical systems, we reviewed the empirical literature on operator information processing and action execution. Using multiple resource theory (MRT; Wickens, 2002) as a guiding framework, we organized this review by the operator perceptual and responding demands which are routinely manipulated in HRI studies. We also reviewed the utility of different interventions for reducing the strain on the perceptual system (e.g., multimodal displays) and responses (e.g., automation). Our synthesis of the literature demonstrates that much is known about how to decrease operator workload, but there are specific gaps in knowledge due to study operations and methodology. This work furthers our understanding of workload in complex environments such as those found when working with robots. Principles and propositions are provided for those interested in decreasing operator workload in applied settings and also for future research.},

To obtain quantitative instruments for these dimensions, this work aimed to explore the validity and reliability of three scales. Two of them describe, respectively, problematic aspects of the area of residence linked to traffic and situations of social degradation that could constitute risk factors for the child's psychological and physical safety (Traffic Danger Perception Scale, Social Danger Perception Scale). The third scale investigates parental perception of the positive potentiality of outdoor autonomy for children's maturation and growth. Interviews were conducted with 377 mothers of children between 8 and 10 years of age residing in six different areas in Italy. The results indicated weak reliability of the Traffic Danger Perception Scale, which requires further investigation, and they confirmed the reliability and the construct validity of the Social Danger Perception Scale and the Perception of Positive Potentiality of Outdoor Autonomy for Children Scale. The perception of social danger was higher in mothers who live in larger urban contexts and who have more personal fear of crime and a lower sense of community. The positive perception of children's autonomy of movement was higher among mothers who live in greener areas, who have a greater sense of community and who have more neighbourhood relations.},

The goal is to improve this ratio and have a single operator supervise up to 10 UAVs. Achieving this goal requires the introduction of automated systems that support multitasking and decision-making. However, there is uncertainty about the appropriate level of automation (LOA). The present study compared re-planning performance at three LOAs (manual, intermediate, full automation) of 30 participants who each supervised 9 UAVs. Full automation resulted in the best re-planning performance and matched intermediate automation in terms of target detection. The manual condition showed significantly poorer performance on these tasks, especially in high workload, but suffered the smallest loss of UAVs. Subjectively, most participants preferred intermediate automation, which they trusted more than full automation. The findings from this research help inform UAV system design and add to the knowledge base in human-automation collaboration.}

The review then contrasts three prevalent perspectives on applying automation: those that focus on the technology itself, on automation within the operating environment, and on automation as a team member. Next, this review discusses two prevalent forms of aviation automation for which significant research and design guidance has been developed: automation based on modal behaviors, such as the flight management system, and alerting functions, which direct attention or motivate action as warranted by events. Finally, the review notes considerations regarding the certification, testing, and evaluation of automation (and human-automation interaction) in the safety-critical domain of aviation.}

On the upside, these social resources provide a multitude of opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they often broadcast more options than can be pursued, given practical restrictions and limited time. This dual nature of social media has driven popular interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out -- popularly referred to as FoMO. Defined as a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, FoMO is characterized by the desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. The present research presents three studies conducted to advance an empirically based understanding of the fear of missing out phenomenon. The first study collected a diverse international sample of participants in order to create a robust individual differences measure of FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs); this study is the first to operationalize the construct. Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort to investigate how demographic, motivational and well-being factors relate to FoMO. Study 3 examined the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of missing out in a sample of young adults. Implications of the FoMOs measure and for the future study of FoMO are discussed.},

The objectives of this study are to measure chiropractic students' grittiness and to explore the correlation between grit and academic performance. METHODS We distributed the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) questionnaire to chiropractic students in electronic form. We included questions about their previous grade point average and the number of times they had retaken examinations. We scored the overall Grit-S scale and the Consistency of Interest and Perseverance of Effort subscales. A 2-tailed t test and 1-way analysis of variance were used to determine differences between groups. RESULTS The response rate was 87\% (n = 110). The mean grit score (3.44 {\textpm} 0.60) was similar to the general population and slightly lower than other healthcare professionals. The students who had a grade point average between {\textbackslash}textless80\% but less than 90\% obtained significantly higher grit scores compared to those who had a grade point average {\textbackslash}textless60\% but less than 70\%. Similarly, students who had no examination retakes had higher grit scores compared to those who took 4 or more exam retakes. We observed these differences in the overall and subscales scores. No other group showed any difference. CONCLUSION The results of this research showed that the grittier students performed better academically than the less gritty students. Grit scores can potentially be used to identify the students at risk of failing or dropping out. The role and potential application of grit in chiropractic education, student support, and admission procedures should be further evaluated.}

Texting while driving can significantly increase the risk of road crashes and is associated with other risky driving behaviors. Most states have enacted distracted driving laws to prohibit texting while driving. This study examines effects of different all-driver distracted driving laws on texting while driving among high school students. Methods: High school student data were extracted from the 2013 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Distracted driving law information was collected from the National Conference of State Legislatures. The final sample included 6,168 high school students above the restricted driving age in their states and with access to a vehicle. Logistic regression was applied to estimate odds ratios of laws on texting while driving. Results: All-driver text messaging bans with primary enforcement were associated with a significant reduction in odds of texting while driving among high school students (odds ratio = 0.703; 95\% confidence interval, 0.513--0.964), whereas all-driver phone use bans with primary enforcement did not have a significant association with texting while driving (odds ratio = 0.846; 95\% confidence interval, 0.501--1.429). Conclusions: The findings indicate that all-driver distracted driving laws that specifically target texting while driving as opposed to all types of phone use are effective in reducing the behavior among high school students.},

Both a single-wire actuated system and an antagonistic configuration system are tested in open and closed loops. The mathematical model of the shape memory alloy wire, as well as the kinematics and dynamics of the robotic arm, are presented. The operational space control of the robotic arm is performed using a joint space control in the inner loop and closed-loop inverse kinematics in the outer loop. In order to choose the best joint space control approach, a comparative study of four different control approaches (proportional derivative, sliding mode, adaptive, and adaptive sliding mode control) is carried out for the proposed model. From this comparative analysis, the adaptive controller was chosen to perform operational space control. This control helps us to perform accurate positioning of the end-effector of shape memory alloy wire--based robotic arm. The complete operational space control was successfully tested through simulation studies performing position reference tracking in the end-effector space. Through simulation studies, the proposed control solution is successfully verified to control the hysteretic robotic arm.}

The selected task is to assemble a few LEGO blocks (parts) into a final product following specified sequence and instructions. The task is divided into several subtasks. A two-level feedforward optimization strategy is developed that determines optimum subtask allocation between the human and the robot before the assembly starts. Human's trust in robot and robot's trust in human are considered, computational models of the trust are derived and real-time trust measurement and display methods are developed. A feedback approach is integrated into the feedforward subtask allocation in the form of subtask re-allocation if trust levels reduce to below specified thresholds. It is hypothesized that subtask re-allocation may help regain trust and maintain satisfactory performance. Experiment results prove that (i) the integrated (feedforward + feedback) optimum subtask allocation is effective to maintain satisfactory trust levels of human and robot that result in satisfactory human--robot interactions (HRI) and assembly performance, and (ii) consideration of two-way trust (human's trust in robot and robot's trust in human) produces better HRI and assembly performance than that produced when one-way trust (human's trust in robot) or no trust is considered.},

  abstract = {Quadrotor or unmanned helicopter is a mobile robot which often flies in unknown environment to perform special missions. In navigational tasks, the robot is intended to fly autonomously toward a target position by following an optimum trajectory. For a successful navigation, controlled attitude, minimum position and velocity error and obstacles collision avoidance are often considered during trajectory tracking procedure. By considering environmental variabilities and due to the existence of noises, uncertainties and unpredictable factors, it is indispensable to steer and control moving robots using sophisticated autonomous algorithms. In this work, a nonlinear model of four-rotor helicopter is simulated. An optimized terminal sliding mode control is then designed to control trajectory tracking. In order to improve the time indices for sliding mode controller, this controller is modified with neural networks. The idea is to optimize the controller parameters through a network learning process which is based on the control process error. The proposed method is evaluated with simulated and real-world indoor navigation tasks. Trajectories that are tracked by quadrotor are generated by a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm and refined with an optimization technique. A well-known simultaneous localization and mapping technique (a camera-based extended Kalman filter-simultaneous localization and mapping) is employed to generate maps, and a path planning algorithm (particle swarm optimization) is utilized to optimize a collision-free flight path using the probability-based maps generated by simultaneous localization and mapping. Simulations and experiment are done in unknown but structured indoor environments containing a number of obstacles. The steady state error, the reaching and settle time and the chattering effect are all quantified and assessed. The controlled experimental flight robustness and sensitivity are further verified for noises occurred on vision and data acquisition system. Results indicate suitable performance for the proposed neural network-sliding mode controller. Less error and more stability were achieved comparative to the conventional sliding mode controllers.}

One of the main goals of automation in aviation is to increase pilots' situation awareness (SA) and reduce their workload -- both of high importance for a safe flight. Increasing automation has historically reduced aviation accident rates and improved efficiency. Yet, currently implemented systems have also contributed to accidents, when failed, or were insufficient to increase pilots' SA for improving their decision-making. This paper discusses the need for an enhanced decision-support system and its potential benefits for safer aviation. A model-based decision support system that leverages artificial intelligence, Integrated Flight Advisory System (IFAS), is presented. Further, the conceptual design of this system is described. The overview and roadmap provided in this paper consist of an effort toward a more holistic, pilot-centered, AI-based decision-support that can contribute to safer aviation.}

Nowadays, drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are ubiquitous and have numerous uses beyond military applications. This is because UAVs can be used in hazardous missions, since they exclude the risk factors involved in manned vehicles. Despite their benefits, UAVs are prone to attacks as they are equipped with numerous on-board sensors to gather data and this exposes them to various vulnerabilities. More precisely, in the absence of manual control, an attacker can gain access to sensitive sensory data and feed fraudulent information to the UAV. As a result, it can be reprogrammed to an undesirable effect and this can cause irreversible damage. This paper provides a general overview of current hacking methods, and defense and trust strategies to overcome cyber attacks on UAVs. To further highlight the importance of the requirement of developing new methods to avoid any intrusion, a hacking procedure is implemented on a commercially available UAV and its severe results are demonstrated. It is shown that the hacker can make irreparable damage and take complete control over the UAV by compromising the communication link between the operator and UAV and uses Robot Operating System-based tools to alter the flight path.}

Vegetation indices (VIs) based on aerial images derived from consumer-grade cameras are a simple and cheap alternative compared to VIs derived from proximal (on-ground) sensors. The objective of this study was to assess whether VIs derived from consumer-grade cameras mounted on UAVs are reliable and whether there are any shortcomings in image acquisition and analysis that need to be addressed before their general application. This objective was investigated using a rotary-wing and a fixed-wing UAV, true colour (RGB) and colour-infrared (CIR) cameras, four different VIs (ExG, NGRDI, NDVI and ENDVI), altitudes in the range of 30--100m, different ambient lighting conditions and two different software packages for stitching images together. Results were compared with ground-based recordings by consumer-grade cameras and multispectral sensors. Field experiments in cereals were used to evaluate the assessments. The study showed that VIs based on UAV imagery have the same ability to quantify crop responses to experimental treatments as ground-based recordings with cameras and advanced sensors. However, there are shortcomings that need to be taken into consideration: (1) angular variation in reflectance (bidirectional reflectance), (2) stitching and (3) ambient light fluctuations. Bidirectional reflectance was so extensive that it could lead to misleading conclusions in sunny conditions and this effect could be amplified further by stitching. A procedure for avoiding impacts from bidirectional reflectance is demonstrated when plots were cropped from individual images and a procedure is suggested for stitching images. Camera, VIs and image acquisition altitude were of minor importance, but fluctuating ambient lighting conditions is an issue that should be addressed in future studies.},

Data were generated from 2 models with 2--7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6--7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The purpose of this study was to examine children's and parents' perspectives and negotiations of CIM within the family unit. Face-to-face interviews and walk-along interviews were conducted with parents (n = 44) and children (n = 22), respectively. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was conducted. Four key preconditions were identified that facilitated negotiation of CIM within family units, including (1) the influence of parents' childhood experiences regarding their view of CIM (e.g., positive interpretations of childhood on parenting practices), (2) the role of children's individual characteristics on their independent mobility (e.g., child's confidence in their abilities), (3) family communication as a key coping strategy (parent--parent and parent--child communication), and (4) the influence of positive perceptions of the social environment on CIM. The findings suggest that CIM thrives when these conditions are present; as a result, it may be particularly helpful to develop policies and programs that support children's skill training, explore strategies to support communication between parents and children, and build neighbourhood connections.},

Here, for the first time, we use a U.K.-representative sample and a genetically sensitive design to unpack the etiology of Grit and its prediction of academic achievement in comparison to well-established personality traits. For 4,642 16-year-olds (2,321 twin pairs), we used the Grit-S scale (perseverance of effort and consistency of interest), along with the Big Five personality traits, to predict grades on the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams, which are administered U.K.-wide at the end of compulsory education. Twin analyses of Grit perseverance yielded a heritability estimate of 37\% (20\% for consistency of interest) and no evidence for shared environmental influence. Personality, primarily conscientiousness, predicts about 6\% of the variance in GCSE grades, but Grit adds little to this prediction. Moreover, multivariate twin analyses showed that roughly two-thirds of the GCSE prediction is mediated genetically. Grit perseverance of effort and Big Five conscientiousness are to a large extent the same trait both phenotypically (r = 0.53) and genetically (genetic correlation = 0.86). We conclude that the etiology of Grit is highly similar to other personality traits, not only in showing substantial genetic influence but also in showing no influence of shared environmental factors. Personality significantly predicts academic achievement, but Grit adds little phenotypically or genetically to the prediction of academic achievement beyond traditional personality factors, especially conscientiousness.

  abstract = {When teaming with humans, the reliability of intelligent agents may sporadically change due to failure or environmental constraints. Alternatively, an agent may be more reliable than a human because their performance is less likely to degrade (e.g., due to fatigue). Research often investigates human-agent interactions under little to no time constraints, such as discrete decision-making tasks where the automation is relegated to the role of an assistant. This paper conducts a quantitative investigation towards varying reliability in human-agent teams in a time-pressured continuous pursuit task, and it interconnects individual differences, perceptual factors, and task performance through structural equation modeling. Results indicate that reducing reliability may generate a more effective agent imperceptibly different from a fully reliable agent, while contributing to overall team performance. The mediation analysis shows replication of factors studied in the trust and situation awareness literature while providing new insights: agents with an active stake in the task (i.e., success is dependent on team performance) offset loss of situation awareness, differing from the usual notion of overtrust. We conclude with generalizing implications from an abstract pursuit task, and we highlight challenges when conducting research in time-pressured continuous domains.}

While previous studies analyzed this phenomena qualitatively, e.g., by showing that users perceive it as meaningless and addictive, yet our understanding of how to discover smartphone habits and mitigate their disruptive effects is limited. Being able to automatically assess habitual smartphone use, in particular, might have different applications, e.g., to design better ``digital wellbeing'' solutions for mitigating meaningless habitual use.To close this gap, we first define a data analytic methodology based on clustering and association rules mining to automatically discover complex smartphone habits from mobile usage data. We assess the methodology over more than 130,000 phone usage sessions collected from users aged between 16 and 33, and we show evidence that smartphone habits of young adults can be characterized by various types of links between contextual situations and usage sessions, which are highly diversified and differently perceived across users. We then apply the proposed methodology in Socialize, a digital wellbeing app that (i) monitors habitual smartphone behaviors in real time and (ii) uses proactive notifications and just-in-time reminders to encourage users to avoid any identified smartphone habits they consider as meaningless. An in-the-wild study with 20 users (ages 19--31) demonstrates that Socialize can assist young adults in better controlling their smartphone usage with a significant reduction of their unwanted smartphone habits.},

Analyzing the effects of interface design in a UAV threat assessment scenario is ideal to examine not only the sensemaking process but also how that process defines decision making in an environment where efficient decision making and low clutter displays are needed. The data from this study will serve determine elements of an optimal interface for information assimilation. Twenty participants were recruited to complete a series of sixteen threat assessment decisions with different interface designs, varying amounts of information and layouts of information.

We review various definitions of and techniques for assessing discriminant validity and provide a generalized definition of discriminant validity based on the correlation between two measures after measurement error has been considered. We then review techniques that have been proposed for discriminant validity assessment, demonstrating some problems and equivalencies of these techniques that have gone unnoticed by prior research. After conducting Monte Carlo simulations that compare the techniques, we present techniques called CICFA(sys) and {$\chi$}2(sys) that applied researchers can use to assess discriminant validity.}

Contextual information may enable operators to infer the appropriateness of data underlying the automation's algorithm. Background: Research has shown the costs of imperfect automation are more detrimental than perfectly reliable automation when operators are provided with decision support tools. Operators may trust and rely on the automation more appropriately if they understand the automation's algorithm. The need to develop decision support tools that are understandable to the operator provides the rationale for the current experiment. Method: A total of 17 participants performed a simulated rapid retasking of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets task with manual, decision automation, or contextual decision automation differing in two levels of task demand: low or high. Automation reliability was set at 80\%, resulting in participants experiencing a mixture of reliable and automation failure trials. Dependent variables included ISR coverage and response time of replanning routes. Results: Reliable automation significantly improved ISR coverage when compared with manual performance. Although performance suffered under imperfect automation, contextual decision automation helped to reduce some of the decrements in performance. Conclusion: Contextual information helps overcome the costs of imperfect decision automation. Application: Designers may mitigate some of the performance decrements experienced with imperfect automation by providing operators with interfaces that display contextual information, that is, the state of factors that affect the reliability of the automation's recommendation.},

In this article, Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) is performed along with the second-order sliding mode control (GW-SoSMC) approach for controlling the yaw angle in AUV. The main purpose of the article is to reduce the error that occurs in the system between the controlled signal and desired signal corresponding to yaw angle. Using this proposed model, both the occurrence of chattering and the controlling performance of AUV system can be diminished. Moreover, the proposed model is compared with the existing approaches like, FireFly-SoSMC (FF-SoSMC), Genetic Algorithm-SoSMC (GA-SoSMC), Gray Wolf-SMC (GW-SMC), Group search optimization-SoSMC (GSO-SoSMC) and Artificial Bee Colony-SoSMC (ABC-SoSMC).

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting USA. Participants Individuals {$\geq$}19 years of age who indicated they were a current driver and participated in the 2011--2014 Traffic Safety Culture Index Surveys (n=9706). Primary outcome The exposure was the presence of a hand-held calling or texting ban applicable to all drivers (ie, universal) at time of survey. Modified Poisson regression with robust SE was used to estimate the risk of engaging in these self-reported behaviours. Results In fully adjusted models, universal texting bans were not associated with lower texting behaviours (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]=0.92; 95\% CI 0.84, 1.01). In stratified, fully adjusted models, men and those of other racial/ethnic origin were 13\% and 33\% less likely, respectively (aRR=0.87; 95\% CI 0.77, 0.98; aRR=0.67; 95\% CI 0.46, 0.97), to engage in texting behaviours if a universal texting ban was effective in their state. Conversely, universal hand-held calling bans were associated with lower self-reported hand-held cellphone conversations across every sub-group. In fully adjusted models, the presence of a hand-held calling ban was associated with 40\% lower (aRR=0.60, 95\% CI 0.54, 0.67) self-reported hand-held cellphone conversations while driving. Conclusions Universal hand-held calling bans were associated with lower self-reported cellphone conversations for adult drivers.

Universal handheld calling bans were associated with lower occurrences of cellphone conversations across all groups except rural drivers. Overall, handheld cellphone bans were associated with 55\% lower (adjusted risk ratio .45, 95\% confidence interval .32--.63) occurrences of cellphone conversations. However, universal texting bans were not associated with fewer texting behaviors in any subgroup. Conclusions: Universal handheld calling bans may discourage adolescents from engaging in handheld phone conversations, whereas universal texting bans may not fully discourage texting behaviors. More interventional or educational work is necessary, particularly addressing texting while driving. {\copyright} 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

  abstract = {The development of research in robotics in a developing country is a challenging task. Factors such as low research funds, low trust from local companies and the government, and a small number of qualified researchers hinder the development of strong, local research groups. In this article, and as a case of study, we present our research group in robotics at the Advanced Mining Technology Center of the Universidad de Chile, and the way in which we have addressed these challenges. In 2008, we decided to focus our research efforts in mining, which is the main industry in Chile. We observed that this industry has needs in terms of safety, productivity, operational continuity, and environmental care. All these needs could be addressed with robotics and automation technology. In a first stage, we concentrate ourselves in building capabilities in field robotics, starting with the automation of a commercial vehicle. An important outcome of this project was the earn of the local mining industry confidence. Then, in a second stage started in 2012, we began working with the local mining industry in technological projects. In this article, we describe three of the technological projects that we have developed with industry support: (i) an autonomous vehicle for mining environments without global positioning system coverage; (ii) the inspection of the irrigation flow in heap leach piles using unmanned aerial vehicles and thermal cameras; and (iii) an enhanced vision system for vehicle teleoperation in adverse climatic conditions.}

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate as to whether grit is best conceptualized and measured as a domain-specific or domain-general construct. In the field of sport psychology, grit has traditionally been conceptualized and measured as a domain-general construct, with the majority of studies using the Grit Scale-Short (Grit-S: Duckworth and Quinn, 2009) to assess grit and its relationships with an array of personality-, performance-, and health-related outcomes. To date, no studies have compared the predictive validity of domain-general and domain-specific versions of the Grit-S with athletes who operate in different achievement settings. In a sample of United Kingdom student-athletes (N = 326, 214 males, 112 females; Mage = 19.55 years, SD = 1.48 years), we examined the degree to which a domain-general version and two domain-specific versions of the Grit-S accounted for variance in two criterion variables that were either situated in an academic context (i.e., emotional exhaustion) or a sport context (i.e., competitive level). Results obtained from a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that an academic-version of the Grit-S explained unique variance in academic emotional exhaustion beyond the variance explained by the domain-general version of the scale, and a sport-version of the Grit-S explained unique variance in competitive level beyond the variance explained by the domain-general version. Results support the adoption of domain-specific approaches to measure grit in specific achievement contexts. Our findings highlight the need for researchers to carefully consider the measurement approaches they adopt when studying grit in individuals who operate across different achievement settings.}

Although opportunities for commercial contract cheating are widely available in the form of essay mills, only about 3\% of students engage in this behaviour. This study examined the reasons why most students do not engage in contract cheating. Students (n = 1204) completed a survey on why they do not engage in contract cheating as well as measures of several individual differences, including self-control, grit and the Dark Triad traits. Morality and motivation for learning received the greatest endorsement for why students do not engage in contract cheating. Controlling for gender, individual differences predicted students' reasons for not contract cheating. This study supports the use of criminological theories relating to rational choice, self-control and opportunity to explain why students do not engage in contract cheating. Practically, this study may inform academic policies and assessment design that may reduce contract cheating.}

Just as all civil airspace was cleared after the 9/11 attacks, the US-Canada border was also frozen, causing economic slowdowns. Border policies are caught between these two panics: security failures and economic crisis. To escape this paradox, American and Canadian authorities have implemented a series of security measures to make the border ``smarter'', notably the implementation of biometric identity documents and surveillance by UAV Predator drones. Psychoanalytic theory can help us explain why the Canadian and American governments have invested so much money for so little evident or measurable increase in either security or economic flows. The article uses the notion of phantastic objects to explain these (over-)reactions to risk management at the US-Canada border.}

An outstanding issue of primary importance is whether age affects grit, ceteris paribus. The 12-item Grit-O Scale and the 8-item Grit-S Scale---from which grit scores are calculated---have not existed for a long period of time. Therefore, Duckworth (2016, p. 37) states in her book, Grit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance, that ``we need a different kind of study'' to distinguish between rival explanations that either generational cohort or age are more important in explaining variation in grit across individuals. Despite this clear data constraint, we obtain a glimpse into the future in the present study by using a within and between generational cohort age difference-in-difference approach. By specifying generation as a categorical variable and age-in-generation as a count variable in the same regression specifications, we are able to account for the effects of variation in age and generation simultaneously, while avoiding problems of multicollinearity that would hinder post-regression statistical inference. We conclude robust, significant evidence that the negative-parabolic shape of the grit-age profile is driven by generational variation and not by age variation. Our findings suggest that, absent a grit-mindset intervention, individual-level grit may be persistent over time.}

While several invocation methods for adaptive automation have been proposed and tested in experimental settings, it is not clear which of these methods can practically be implemented in operational environments. It is therefore important to explore measures that are both predictive of individual performance and that can be easily administered in actual work environments. This study examined the efficacy of using both baseline manual performance and working memory capacity to predict future performance with automation. Participants were assisted by context-dependent adaptive automation during a simulated command and control task. Results showed that baseline performance without automation predicted overall human-automation performance. Working memory capacity did not predict overall performance, but did predict effective use of the automated aids, so that participants with higher working memory scores used the aids more effectively. These results suggest that effectiveness of human-automation teams can be predicted with quick, cost-efficient, easily measureable markers of performance and can therefore provide practical invocation strategies for adaptive automation.}

We have developed a method of collision avoidance that can be used in three dimensions in much the same way as autonomous ground vehicles that navigate over unexplored terrain. Safe navigation is accomplished by a combination of online environmental sensing, path planning and collision avoidance. Here we outline our methodology and report results with an autonomous helicopter that operates at low elevations in uncharted environments, some of which are densely populated with obstacles such as buildings, trees and wires. We have recently completed over 700 successful runs in which the helicopter traveled between coarsely specified waypoints separated by hundreds of meters, at speeds of up to 10 m s---1 at elevations of 5---11 m above ground level. The helicopter safely avoids large objects such as buildings and trees but also wires as thin as 6 mm. We believe this represents the first time an air vehicle has traveled this fast so close to obstacles. The collision avoidance method learns to avoid obstacles by observing the performance of a human operator.}

In current human-Artificial Intelligent Agent (AIA) Teams, humans explicitly communicate task-oriented goals and how the goals are to be achieved to the AIAs as the AIAs do not support implicit communication. This research develops a construct for applying quality goals to improve coordination among human-AIA teams. This construct assumes that trained operators will exhibit similar priorities in similar situations and provides a shorthand communication mechanism to convey intentions. A study was designed and performed to assess situated operator priorities to provide insight into ``how'' operators desire a task to be performed. This assessment was performed episodically by trained and experienced Remotely Piloted Aircraft operators as they controlled an aircraft in a synthetic task environment through three challenging tactical scenarios. The results indicate that operator priorities change dynamically with situation changes. Further, the results are suitably cohesive across most trained operators to apply the data collected from the proposed method as training data to bootstrap development of an intent estimation agent. However, the data differed sufficiently among individual operators to justify the development of operator specific models, necessary for robust estimation of operator priorities to indicate ``how'' task-oriented goals should be pursued.}

Participants completed several self-report surveys gauging texting habits, personality, and sensation seeking. General findings indicated that extraversion and neuroticism were positively related to some socially problematic texting behaviors, but unexpectedly, extraversion was related to non-social aspects of texting, such as texting while driving. The disinhibition subscale was most strongly related to almost all of the problematic texting behaviors that we assessed, most notably for texting and driving. Based on these findings, an example of using individual differences to improve analyses of problematic texting behavior is provided. Additional results and implications for human factors are further discussed.}

At the core of our approach are (a) a sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary, and (b) an efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety Our algorithm is implemented in a software package called TrajOpt. We report results from a series of experiments comparing TrajOpt with CHOMP and randomized planners from OMPL, with regard to planning time and path quality. We consider motion planning for 7 DOF robot arms, 18 DOF full-body robots, statically stable walking motion for the 34 DOF Atlas humanoid robot, and physical experiments with the 18 DOF PR2. We also apply TrajOpt to plan curvature-constrained steerable needle trajectories in the SE(3) configuration space and multiple non-intersecting curved channels within 3D-printed implants for intracavitary brachytherapy.

First, we find that subgroups overestimate other subgroups? behavioral autonomy, which promotes holding simplified, negative images of each other. Second, subgroups adopt vertical disidentification when they define their own particular role. Third, cooperativeness conceals pejorative perceptions.}

The present research examined mathematics self-efficacy and the relationship of racial context from the perspective of two competing bodies of research. Stereotype threat theory would predict that, under conditions where negative stereotypes are salient, self-efficacy would decrease. So, Black/African American students in primarily White classrooms would be predicted to report lower self-efficacy. However, other research suggests that Black/African American students demonstrate fortitude even under disadvantage (e.g., Graham, Review of Educational Research, 64(1): 55--117, 1994). We examined the mathematics self-efficacy of 170 fifth-grade students. In contrast to stereotype threat theory, results suggested that Black/African American students' self-efficacy remained stable regardless of the racial breakdown of the class. However, White students demonstrated elevated self-efficacy when in predominantly Black/African American classrooms. These results could not be explained by differences in classroom environments. Results are discussed in terms of resilience, ethnic identity and White identity.}

In the present study we found Task-Team Balancing significantly declined with increasing team experience and appears correlated with team cohesion. The TWLQ may be a useful subjective measure that can be used to assess the workload demand in team tasks. It provides researchers with a tool to advance the understating of team workload and gives practitioners the means to assess the workload demands of team tasks.}

  abstract = {The advances and convergence in sensor, information processing, and communication technologies have shaped the Internet of Things of today. The rapid increase of data and service requirements brings new challenges for Internet of Thing. Emerging technologies and intelligent techniques can play a compelling role in prompting the development of intelligent architectures and services in Internet of Things to form the artificial intelligence Internet of Things. In this article, we give an introduction and review recent developments of artificial intelligence Internet of Things, the various artificial intelligence Internet of Things computational frameworks and highlight the challenges and opportunities for effective deployment of artificial intelligence Internet of Things technology to address complex problems for various applications. This article surveys the recent developments and discusses the convergence of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things from four aspects: (1) architectures, techniques, and hardware platforms for artificial intelligence Internet of Things; (2) sensors, devices, and energy approaches for artificial intelligence Internet of Things; (3) communication and networking for artificial intelligence Internet of Things; and (4) applications for artificial intelligence Internet of Things. The article also discusses the combination of smart sensors, edge computing, and software-defined networks as enabling technologies for the artificial intelligence Internet of Things.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study explores the connections between formal quantitative group characteristics (such as group size, group composition by gender, age, and duration of group membership of individual workers, their average age, and duration of membership) with three levels of conflict (ie, interpersonal, individual-group, and individual-subgroup) of two types (ie, activity-oriented and subject-oriented). METHOD: Forty-one work groups - small-size enterprises and basic-level teams and units in medium-size companies and large corporations, with the total sample of 334 individual workers - took part in the study. The study employed the questionnaire of interpersonal conflicts in a group and the questionnaire of individual-group and micro-group conflicts as assessment tools. Subsequent regression analyses explored the relationships between group size and composition on one hand and types and levels of conflict on the other. RESULTS: The study established that group size is negatively associated with the individual-subgroup subject-oriented conflict. Also, group size moderates the connections between several formal group characteristics and conflict types and levels. These connections are detected in large-size groups but are nearly nonexistent in small-size groups. Group diversity by gender is negatively associated with the individual-group activity-oriented conflict (across all participating groups) and with the interpersonal and individual-group subject-oriented conflicts (in large-size groups only). Group composition by duration of group membership is negatively associated with the individual-subgroup subject-oriented conflict (across groups), participants' average age and duration of group membership - with both types of the individual-subgroup conflict. Out of all group characteristics under consideration, only group composition by age was not associated with either of the conflict parameters. DISCUSSION: The paper makes a special point out of the fact that group characteristics served as much stronger predictors for conflict parameters in large-size groups than either in small-size groups or in the entire sample, indicating that the increase in group size strengthens the influence of group characteristics on conflict parameters. CONCLUSION: The research findings indicate that it is important, when studying connections between group composition and conflicts within the group, to take group size and its influence on types and levels of the intragroup conflict into account.},

In the group as a whole, both the size of the group and the number of informal subgroups in it have a positive relationship with subgroup\&ndash;subgroup conflict in both types and subgroup\&ndash;group subject-oriented conflict, and have a negative connection with micro-group subject-oriented conflict. In turn, the size of the subgroup is positively associated with the two types of subgroup\&ndash;group conflict and negatively connected with the two types of micro-group conflict, as well as with interpersonal activity-oriented conflict at the level of the informal subgroup.},

Results indicated that trust in companies and scientists performing gene manipulations have a strong effect on the benefits and risks perceived. When trust was controlled for the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit vanished. Furthermore, world views, perceived benefit, and perceived risk each are found to contribute independently to the prediction of acceptance of gene technology.

But how does stereotype threat translate into fewer women motivated for science? In this quantitative study with a sample from the US, we use Expectancy Value Theory to examine whether and how stereotype threat concerns might influence women's science identification. To do this, we collected survey data from 388 women enrolled in introductory physics (male-dominated) and biology (female-dominated) undergraduate laboratory classes at three universities. We examined multiple indirect effect paths through which stereotype threat could be associated with science identity and the associated future motivation to engage in scientific research. In addition to replicating established expectancy-value theory motivational findings, results support the novel prediction that one route through which stereotype threat negatively impacts women's science identity is via effects on perceptions about the communal utility value of science. Especially among women in physics who expressed greater stereotype threat concerns than women in biology, science identification was lower to the extent that stereotype threat reduced how useful science was seen for helping other people and society. Implications for ways to create an inclusive learning context that combats stereotype threat concerns and broadens undergraduate women's participation in science are discussed.}

It examines the evolution of the US deployment and factors which complicated the US strategic objectives in Afghanistan, including the persistent tension in the US national security objectives between counter-terrorism and nation-building objectives. It argues that the US faces limited palatable options regarding its post-withdrawal Afghanistan policy and that moving forward, policy will be constrained by a mix of situational and structural variables. These include US domestic politics, the Taliban regime itself (and its relationship with ISIS-K) and the region's geopolitical winds, notably the strategic positions of Iran, Pakistan, China and to a lesser extent Russia.}

Educational interventions aimed at increasing grit and resilience have produced mixed results. Developing protective factors appears to be the most common approach in helping students become more resilient. Summary. Literature pertaining to grit and resilience reveals that the terms are nuanced, complex, and difficult to measure and understand. Regardless, the general characteristics associated with grit and resilience are of interest to educators and warrant further study.}

Integrating social network theory with input?process?output models of team innovation, our research aims to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature by introducing a novel process perspective as well as highlighting a relevant contingency factor to untangle the team social capital?team innovation link. We propose that team social capital, operationalized as bridging and bonding social capital, negatively influences team innovation via team proportional task conflict, which is the level of task conflict teams experience proportional to the general level of team conflict (i.e. task, relationship and process conflict). In addition, we expected group and differentiated individual-focused transformational leadership to buffer the negative indirect effect of team social capital on team innovation via team proportional task conflict. Results from time-lagged data collected from research and development teams in Iraq revealed that teams with bonding and bridging social capital are less innovative because they experience less proportional task conflict. Furthermore, group-focused transformational leadership buffered the negative indirect relationship of team bridging social capital on team innovation via proportional task conflict. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.}

Results indicate that single drone use can increase time for operation, but accuracy and safety of clearing is enhanced. Single drone use saw increased situational awareness, a decrease in number of targets missed, and a moderate level of trust. For drone swarms, results indicate significant differences in mental workload from swarm data feeds compared to single drone feeds but no substantial difference in accuracy of finding targets.}

Responses that were correct despite incorrect automated advice were slower than matched manual responses. Decision aids set at lower reliability (75\%) had smaller effects on choices and response times, and were subjectively trusted less, than decision aids set at higher reliability (95\%). We fitted an evidence accumulation model to choices and response times to measure how information processing was affected by decision aid inputs. Participants primarily treated low-reliability decision aids as an advisor rather than directly accumulating evidence based on its advice. Participants directly accumulated evidence based upon the advice of high-reliability decision aids, consistent with granting decision aids more autonomous influence over decisions. Individual differences in the level of direct accumulation correlated with subjective trust, suggesting a cognitive mechanism by which trust impacts human decisions.

The main goal of this  research is to analyze the psychometric implications of the use of positive and  reversed items in measurement instruments. METHOD: A sample of 374 participants  was tested aged between 18 and 73 (M=33.98; SD=14.12), 62.60\% were women. A  repeated measures design was used, evaluating the participants with positive,  reversed, and combined forms of a self-efficacy test. RESULTS: When combinations  of positive and reversed items are used in the same test the reliability of the  test is flawed and the unidimensionality of the test is jeopardized by secondary  sources of variance. In addition, the variance of the scores is reduced, and the  means differ significantly from those in tests in which all items are either  positive or reversed, but not combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study  present a trade-off between a potential acquiescence bias when items are  positively worded and a potential different understanding when combining regular  and reversed items in the same test. The specialized literature recommends  combining regular and reversed items for controlling for response style bias, but  these results caution researchers in using them as well after accounting for the  potential effect of linguistic skills and the findings presented in this study.},

Therefore, it has become more critical to produce highly reliable software to meet the safety requirements established by functional safety standards, such as IEC 61508, ISO 26262, and EN 50128. IEC 61508 supports well-known safety mechanisms such as design diversity like N-version (multi-version) programming. N-version (multi-version) programming is a method where multiple functionally equivalent programs are independently developed from the same software specifications. N-version (multi-version) programming is particularly an effective approach to increase the quality of software in a safety-critical system. In this paper, one of the well-known and widely used algorithms in the field of N-version (multi-version) programming, the majority voting algorithm, has been modified with an online stability checker where the decisions of the voter are judged against the stability of the underlying system. The plant where all the theoretical results are implemented is a tilt-rotor system with the proposed N-version (multi-version) programming--based controller. The experimental results show that the modified majority voter-based N-version (multi-version) programming controller provides more reliable control of the plant.}

Methods Eligible individuals recruited from four emergency departments from December 2019 to June 2021 were aged 18--25~years who reported TWD in the past 2 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to intervention:assessment control. The intervention arm (n~= 57) received an automated interactive text message program, including weekly queries about TWD for 6 weeks with feedback and goal support to promote cessation of TWD. The assessment control arm (n~= 55) received identical weekly TWD queries but no additional feedback. Outcomes were collected via web-based self-assessments at 6- and 12 weeks and analyzed under intent-to-treat models, presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean (SD) age was 21.7 (2.1) years, 73 (65\%) were female, and 40 (36\%) were White. The 6-week follow-up rate was 77.7\% (n~= 87) and 12-week follow-up rate was 64.3\% (n~= 72). At 6 weeks, 52.6\% (95\% CI, 39.0\%--66.0\%) of intervention participants reported TWD versus 63.6\% (95\% CI, 49.6\%--76.2\%) of control participants (adjusted OR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.32--1.59). At 12~weeks, 38.2\% (95\% CI, 22.8\%--53.5\%) of intervention participants reported TWD versus 69.3\% (95\% CI, 53.8\%--84.7\%) of control participants (adjusted OR, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.11--0.80). Discussion An interactive text message intervention was more effective at reducing self-reported TWD among young adults than assessment control at 12 weeks.},

  abstract = {The governmental restriction due to COVID-19 pandemic led to Italian Universities moving teaching from face-to-face, to online. This represented an unexpected transition from traditional learning to what can be considered ``e-learning.'' This, together with the psychological distress that may be associated with the experience of lockdown, might have affected students' performance. It was hypothesised that grit may be a protective factor in such situations. Indeed, compared to their less ``gritty'' peers, individuals with higher levels of grit are expected to exhibit greater persistence in the pursuit of goals despite setbacks. Within educational contexts, grit is portrayed as a potentially important influence on outcomes such as achievement level, retention and probability of graduation. A longitudinal study was conducted using an online survey in order to assess the moderated mediation effect of grit on students' achievement. One hundred seventy-six undergraduate students from two universities in the north of Italy participated in the survey. The results showed that grit affects students' grades in final exams; perceived self-efficacy in the management of complex problems had a mediation effect on grades, while psychological distress moderated the first part of the mediation process. These novel findings extended our knowledge regarding the role of grit in academic performance investigating for the first time the role of self-efficacy and psychological distress in a learning carried out entirely online.}

We propose that leaders' prestige- and dominance-oriented status behaviors are positively related to supportive and coercive interactions among members, respectively, which in turn predict team creativity. Empirical analysis based on the multisource data of 53 work teams confirmed that leader prestige behavior exerted a positive indirect effect on team creativity through increased supportive intermember interaction. The indirect effect of leader prestige behavior was significant only when team status conflict was low. By contrast, leader dominance behavior exhibited a positive effect on coercive intermember interaction, which was not significantly related to team creativity. A post hoc analysis revealed that leader dominance behavior had a negative indirect effect on team creativity through decreased supportive interaction among members. This study provides meaningful theoretical insights into the interactive effects of leader status behaviors and team status conflict that lead to distinct collective group processes and team creative output.},

A longitudinal model of team interaction is presented and tested at the individual level to consider the extent to which both formal and informal network connections?measured as degree centrality?relate to changes in team members? individual perceptions of cohesion and conflict in their teams, and their individual performance as a team member over time. The study showed a negative network centrality-cohesion relationship with significant temporal patterns, indicating that as team members perceive less degree centrality in distributed project teams, they report more team cohesion during the last four months of the project. We also found that changes in team cohesion from the first three months (i.e., early development stage) to the last four months (i.e., late development stage) of the project relate positively to changes in team member performance. Although degree centrality did not relate significantly to changes in team conflict over time, a strong inverse relationship was found between changes in team conflict and cohesion, suggesting that team conflict emphasizes a different but related aspect of how individuals view their experience with the team process. Changes in team conflict, however, did not relate to changes in team member performance. Ultimately, we showed that individuals, who are less central in the network and report higher levels of team cohesion, performed better in distributed teams over time.}

The idea that guilt and shame are necessary components of mothering is widespread. A few sources take seriously the emotions of guilt and shame nor has considerable thought been given to the social nature of guilt and shame. Rather than accept a purely psychological explanation of guilt and shame, I investigate the institutional and interactional dynamics that fuel women's drives to perform as `the good mother'. In particular, I explore the `good mothering' ideology that places mothers at risk of guilt and shame and then two social and institutional spaces where guilt and shame are likely to be prevalent.}

First, we tested geographical generalizability of associations between grit and orientations towards happiness by comparing previous studies in the U.S. and the current study in Japan. It was confirmed that orientation towards meaning rather than orientation towards engagement had a stronger positive correlation with grit in our sample of Japanese people. This result is inconsistent with previous studies in the U.S. Furthermore, the Big Five dimension of Openness to Experience was newly confirmed as having a positive association with grit. Second, we examined the association between grit and work engagement, which is considered as an outcome indicator for work performance. In this analysis, grit was a strong predictor for work performance as well as academic performance.}

We discuss the implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract a broader audience to cybersecurity.},

In addition, our findings reveal a significant mediation. Specifically, compared to perceived risk, perceived benefit manifested a greater mediation on the pleasure--general acceptance as well as subjective knowledge-general acceptance relationship. It is also emphasized that practitioners should improve emotional design and publicity strategies to improve users' perception of FAV benefits and thus improve acceptance.},

Further, the present study examined whether growth mindset and goal commitment impacted grit and whether grit acted as a mediator between growth mindset, goal commitment, and achievement outcomes. The results showed that the perseverance facet of grit in the eighth grade was associated with school achievement and engagement in the nineth grade, after controlling for students' conscientiousness, academic persistence, prior achievement and engagement, gender and SES, although the effect on engagement was stronger than on achievement. In addition, grit was predicted by goal commitment in the sixth grade, but not by the growth mindset in the sixth grade. Finally, the perseverance of effort (not the consistency of interest) mediated the effect of goal commitment on engagement. These findings suggest that grit is associated with increased engagement and academic achievement; and practitioners who wish to improve grit of adolescents may encourage goal commitment more than growth mindset.}

Method A total of 2,839 lower secondary (grade 8), higher secondary (grade 11), and vocational (year 12) students from 21 schools in Chiang Mai, Thailand participated in a survey that measured Grit using the Short Grit Scale. Bivariate analysis was conducted using the t-test, ANOVA, or Kruskal--Wallis H test as appropriate. Multiple ordinary least squares linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with Grit. Results Satisfactory relationships with teachers (p = 0.01), parental support (p = 0.03), interest in school (p = 0.01), having been asked by parents to do homework ({\textbackslash}beta = {\textbackslash}textminus0.69; p = 0.012), and having been told by parents that they had done something bad ({\textbackslash}beta = {\textbackslash}textminus1.09; p = 0.02) associated with Grit.

Using longitudinal data among Finnish eighth and ninth graders (n\,=\,549, 59.4\% female, age\,=\,14--16), the longitudinal changes in grit and academic goal commitment profiles were investigated through latent profile and latent transition analyses. Four profiles were identified across two grades: High committed-persistent and moderate consistency ({\textasciitilde}17\%), Moderate ({\textasciitilde}60\%), Low committed-persistent and moderate-low consistency ({\textasciitilde}8\%) and Extremely low committed-persistent and moderate-low consistency ({\textasciitilde}12\%). The students in the High committed-persistent and moderate consistency profile had the highest academic achievement of all the profiles when controlled for gender, socioeconomic status, conscientiousness, and academic persistence. The results revealed that students' profiles changed between the eighth and ninth grades, with more than one-third of the High committed-persistent and moderate consistency adolescents dropping from this group. Further analysis showed that the profiles varied by educational aspiration, gender, and socioeconomic status. These findings imply that the combination of grit and academic goal commitment influences academic achievement; however, this combination is less common, unstable, and affected by internal and external factors. The study provided important implications on the weak grit effect and the ways to improve it.}

These definitions show how both constructs have common borders, to the extent that they allow identifying academic goals and deploying various strategies to achieve them. However, there are not many studies in which they are comprehensively addressed, and pedagogical proposals are designed to promote them at the university level. In that regard, the present research had four objectives: to describe the levels of Grit and academic selfregulation of students in three university courses; to find out if there are differences in the two abilities according to the students' sex; to analyse how Grit and academic self-regulation correlate; and to identify whether Grit predicts high self-regulation rates in students. A quantitative, descriptive, correlational, and predictive methodology was used in a non-probabilistic and convenience sample of 174 students studying Law, Political Science, and International Relations at a private university in Argentina, with an average age of 19.13 years. Differences were found both in tenacity and academic self-regulation according to career, favouring women in some variables of self-regulation but not in tenacity according to sex. Significant and positive correlations were found between tenacity and self-regulation.

Para comprender c{\textbackslash}' omo el Grit influye positivamente sobre diversas variables, como el rendimiento acad{\textbackslash}' emico, deportivo y laboral, el bienestar y la satisfacci{\textbackslash}' on con la vida, se efectuaron numerosas investigaciones en las que estas tem{\textbackslash}' aticas fueron abordadas (Argon y kaya, 2018; Fabelico y Afalla, 2020; Jin y Kim, 2017; Li et al., 2018; L{\textbackslash}' opez Ruiz, 2020). Las indagaciones efectuadas permitieron encontrar similitudes conceptuales entre el Grit y la autoconciencia; y hallar aristas en com{\textbackslash}' un entre las variables que lo conforman y otros constructos como la resiliencia, la motivaci{\textbackslash}' on, el optimismo, el compromiso, la proactividad y la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on (Cred{\textbackslash}' e et al., 2017; Daura et al., 2020; PerkinsGough, 2013). En lo que respecta a la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on acad{\textbackslash}' emica, constructo que cuenta con m{\textbackslash}' as de tres d{\textbackslash}' ecadas de trayectoria, no existe un acuerdo en relaci{\textbackslash}' on a c{\textbackslash}' omo definirlo, lo que se debe a la existencia de distintas l{\textbackslash}' ineas de pensamiento y de teor{\textbackslash}' ias que resaltan un aspecto u otro del mismo (Pintrich, 1998). Son numerosas las publicaciones sobre el t{\textbackslash}' opico que han ofrecido importantes contribuciones al estudio del aprendizaje en general y sobre el aprendizaje autorregulado en particular. Todas coinciden en afirmar que la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on no es una capacidad innata, sino que puede desarrollarse por la pr{\textbackslash}' actica, en forma proactiva, permitiendo transformar las habilidades mentales, motivacionales y afectivas en habilidades de estudio (Torrano Montalvo y Gonz{\textbackslash}' alez Torres, 2004; Zimmerman y Schunk, 2001a). El punto clave que define este tipo de aprendizaje es que el estudiante posea iniciativa personal, capacidad metacognitiva y regulaci{\textbackslash}' on motivacional, emocional y cognitiva para dirigir su conducta y otros aspectos hacia las metas que se proponga (Boakaerts, 1999). Entre los enfoques te{\textbackslash}' oricos existentes, se destaca el planteado por la teor{\textbackslash}' ia Sociocognitiva en la que se encuentran los modelos de Zimmerman (2001) y Pintrich (2000) quienes, a su vez, dise{$\sim$} naron instrumentos que permiten evaluar esta capacidad. Pintrich (2000, 2004), particularmente, es reconocido como el precursor en explicar la correlaci{\textbackslash}' on existente entre las variables motivacionales y cognitivas que se ponen en juego en el proceso de aprendizaje (Lim{\textbackslash}' on Luque, 2004); aspecto que, aunque en la actualidad se concibe como un factor innegable, con antelaci{\textbackslash}' on al abordaje 118 Florencia Teresita Daura, Cecilia Barni y Mariela Gonz{\textbackslash}' alez planteado por el autor no se lo explicaba con claridad, existiendo enfoques y modelos sobre el aprendizaje autorregulado que s{\textbackslash}' olo lo comprend{\textbackslash}' ian como un constructo de nivel cognitivo, excluyendo variables de orden motivacional y afectivo que incid{\textbackslash}' ian sobre el rendimiento acad{\textbackslash}' emico (Zimmerman y Shunk, 2001b). Desde esta concepci{\textbackslash}' on, el aprendizaje autorregulado se comprende como ``un proceso de construcci{\textbackslash}' on activo por el cual los estudiantes eligen metas de aprendizaje e intentan monitorear, regular y controlar su cognici{\textbackslash}' on, su motivaci{\textbackslash}' on y su conducta, guiados por metas personales y por el contexto. Estas actividades de autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on pueden mediar las relaciones entre los individuos, el contexto y sus logros'' (Pintrich, 2000, p. 453). Para Pintrich (2000, 2004) todo proceso regulatorio se realiza en torno a cuatro {\textbackslash}' areas (cognitiva, afectivo-motivacional, comportamental y contextual) y se organiza en cuatro fases que son complementarias, no guardan un orden jer{\textbackslash}' arquico, est{\textbackslash}' an ordenadas temporalmente y poseen subprocesos internos, conformando un modelo caracter{\textbackslash}' istico: fase 1 de previsi{\textbackslash}' on, planificaci{\textbackslash}' on y activaci{\textbackslash}' on; fase 2 de monitoreo; fase 3 de control; y fase 4 de reflexi{\textbackslash}' on y acci{\textbackslash}' on. A partir de las definiciones y caracter{\textbackslash}' isticas brindadas sobre la tenacidad y la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on puede anticiparse c{\textbackslash}' omo ambas comparten notas en com{\textbackslash}' un. En efecto, tanto la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on del aprendizaje como la tenacidad se necesitan para identificar metas --en este caso acad{\textbackslash}' emicas-- y efectuar un esfuerzo por alcanzarlas; para lo cual, se debe planificar, actuar, controlar y evaluar diversas variables. No obstante, la vinculaci{\textbackslash}' on entre ambos constructos ha sido poco estudiada hasta el momento (Wolters y Hussain, 2015), de all{\textbackslash}' i es que la importancia y la necesidad de la presente investigaci{\textbackslash}' on radica, por un lado, en cubrir la laguna existente explorando, entre otros aspectos, c{\textbackslash}' omo la tenacidad puede predecir {\textbackslash}' indices superiores de autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on acad{\textbackslash}' emica; y, por el otro, anticipar implicaciones educativas dirigidas a favorecer ambas capacidades en el estudiantado universitario. Esto permitir{\textbackslash}' a brindar aportes para vincular meta te{\textbackslash}' oricamente ambos constructos. Sobre la base de estas ideas, en el desarrollo del estudio se plantearon los siguientes objetivos: -Describir los niveles de tenacidad y de autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on acad{\textbackslash}' emica que poseen los estudiantes de las carreras de abogac{\textbackslash}' ia, licenciatura en ciencias pol{\textbackslash}' iticas y licenciatura en relaciones internacionales impartidas por una universidad privada. -Analizar si existen diferencias en la tenacidad y en la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on acad{\textbackslash}' emica seg{\textbackslash}' un el sexo de los estudiantes. -Analizar c{\textbackslash}' omo correlacionan la tenacidad y la autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on acad{\textbackslash}' emica en la muestra integrada por estudiantes universitarios. -Identificar el valor predictivo de los factores que conforman la tenacidad sobre los {\textbackslash}' indices de autorregulaci{\textbackslash}' on de los participantes.

  abstract = {The success or failure of a system can impact one's trust in that system. User trust can also be affected by system behavior (e.g., type of movement, how social it is, human-likeness). However, there remains a gap in understanding the relationship between these two influences. Additionally, few studies have examined trust following differences in the behavior of systems with consistently successful results across behaviors. Therefore, the degree to which the behavior of a system in the pursuit of a successful outcome can influence user trust is unknown. In one experiment, participants were tasked with plotting a path for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to fly. The UAV deviated from the path by different amounts, between subjects. Despite no differences in measures of performance (the success of the UAV reaching the end destination, time to complete the task, end score, or how far participants had to draw the routes), nor other cognitive constructs (i.e., workload), differences in trust were reported. These results indicate that it is not simply if a system accomplishes a task, but also the way it does that influences trust.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Nursing is both a science and an art and requires students to develop sound scientific foundations for artful application. The at times binary nature of how the way in which the knowledge and skills of nursing are delivered in higher education can be difficult for students to comprehend initially and synchronise for practice and can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed, withdrawal or failure. Understanding what influences student performance in bachelor level nursing studies is imperative so educators can develop programs that straddle the art and science conundrum and lead to graduate success. Grit is a non-cognitive trait, a drive that keeps an individual on task through difficult circumstances for sustained periods of time. Grit might well represent a key factor in our understanding of why one student succeeds while another withdraws. OBJECTIVES To examine measures of grit in the context of demographic characteristics of nursing students and their impact on student self-perceived academic and clinical performance. DESIGN A cross-sectional design. SETTING A single School of Nursing at a multi-campus, regional, peri-urban Australian University. PARTICIPANTS All nursing students (n = 2349) studying a three-year bachelor of nursing degree were invited to participate. METHODS Data were collected using a questionnaire that included several demographic items, questions relating to the student's perceived level of academic and clinical performance, and the eight-item Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) used to measure trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals. RESULTS Students, regardless of their year of study or any other demographic factor, showed grit was the only significant predictor of clinical and academic performance. CONCLUSIONS The strength between grit and perceived performance both academically and clinically, makes grit a valuable factor for development in students as a vehicle for success in nursing programs of study. This paper culminates in suggestions for creative approaches to grit development.}

All students (n = 2349) within the program were invited to complete a questionnaire which included the short grit scale (Grit-S) which measured each student's level of perseverance and passion. Overall, it was highlighted that increased levels of grit correlated with an increase in the student's year of study, greater perceived clinical and academic performance, not using television as a motivator for entry to nursing, being lower on the socio-economic spectrum, and being older in age. Grit was found to develop exponentially as students entered second and third years, suggesting that a balance of constant academic and clinical challenge was an impetus for many to achieve in the face of adversity, and is reminiscent of the journey of the koi fish. This paper culminates in a call for educators to consider the inclusion of creative grit forming challenges that focus on developing a student's sense of open-mindedness within first year of undergraduate nursing programs.}

  abstract = {Past research overwhelmingly suggests that relationship conflict (RC) has negative effects on team processes and performance. However, little research has investigated the effects of RC through a temporal lens with an eye toward overcoming the short-term deleterious consequences of RC. Integrating threat rigidity and threat regulation theories, we first argue that RC disrupts team processes over time because members feel threatened and, second, that cognitive reappraisal, as an emotion regulation strategy, is a threat regulation mechanism by which teams can overcome RC. Specifically, we examine the influence of early-stage RC on team process trajectories, the moderating effect of team-level cognitive reappraisal on these trajectories, and the team performance implications of team processes. Testing our predictions in both field and laboratory studies with conditional linear growth modeling, we show that while teams with high early-stage RC are lower initially on critical team processes (coordination and interpersonal processes), they incrementally ?rebound? from these lower levels of team processes if team members have a tendency to cognitively reappraise past affective events. Further, we find that changes in perceived threat stemming from early-stage RC drives these effects. Finally, we find that as a result of managing early-stage RC through cognitive reappraisal, team performance does not suffer. Overall, these results suggest that teams can overcome the negative effects of early-stage RC by addressing underlying appraisals of threat, and that they may benefit in the long run from the struggle of doing so. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.}

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an extended period of disruption in peoples' lives and could result in long-term changes towards travel attitudes, and use of transport services. There has previously been little research available on changes towards travel attitudes and use of domestic travel as a result of pandemics. To investigate the changes in attitudes to travel resulting from COVID-19 we distributed a survey to 787 respondents in Australia and New Zealand asking about car use, car sharing, public transport, and air travel before, during, and after COVID-19 travel restrictions. The results showed attitudes towards travel were negatively affected, particularly attitudes towards public transport and international air travel. Further, although respondents indicated some recovery in attitudes when asked to consider when travel restrictions were removed, they did not recover to the levels of positivity seen pre-COVID. There were slight differences between the two countries in their post-COVID attitudes, possibly due to their different experience of travel restriction. Both countries, however, may be useful as a preview for the rest of the world given the early cessation of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the survey.},

The past history good of relations coupled with similarity of views with respect to what ought to be the world order and extensive defence cooperation has laid down a firm basis for their relations.

For air-breathing vehicles, 3D trajectory planning will become extremely important due to its significant impact on flight performance. Past research on this issue was not comprehensive enough. Thus, we proposed a hybrid method for generating the optimal trajectories efficiently. No-fly zones are specified for geopolitical restrictions in air-breathing hypersonic vehicle missions. However, previous studies focused on no-fly zone constraints with fixed locations and boundaries. For robust execution, we must take into account no-fly zones' uncertainties, which arise due to uncertain localization, measurement errors, and no-fly zones' movement. A chance-constrained approach is presented here to deal with such uncertainties. The key idea of this method is controlling risk when the flight path is close to the uncertain no-fly zones. First, the trajectory planning of air-breathing hypersonic vehicles is modeled as a chance-constrained optimization (CCOPT) problem. With the help of the convexification and linearization techniques, we can approximate the non 3.2.2 CCOPT problem as a convex second-order cone programing under the Gaussian distribution assumption. It can be solved to global optimality by the interior point method. Finally, we give numerical simulation results to prove the effectiveness of this method.}

Previously, researchers have explored the determinants of fully autonomous vehicles but the relevant research is far from enough. Moreover, the relationship between anthropomorphism and users' behavior has been ignored to a large extent. Therefore, this study aim to fill the gap by using anthropomorphism and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explore how system attributes (i.e., perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence) and UTAUT attributes influence consumers' acceptance behavior. The data were collected via questionnaire survey conducted in Beijing, China, which can be a promising early adopter of AVs. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results reveal that perceived anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence have a direct positive influence on the adoption of AVs; performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions have an indirect positive influence on intention to adopt AVs. Also, this research contributes to the literature by enriching studies on psychological determinants of autonomous vehicles' adoption by taking an initial step to highlight anthropomorphism perceptions. This can provide managerial implications for policy-makers and businesses on how to effectively allocate resources to enhance autonomous vehicle adoption.}

In its place, the percentile bootstrap confidence interval (PBCI), which does not adjust for bias, is currently the recommended inferential method for indirect effects. This study proposes two alternative bias-corrected bootstrap methods for creating confidence intervals around the indirect effect: one originally used by Stine ({$<$}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"{$>$}1989{$<$}/xref{$>$}) with the correlation coefficient, and a novel method that implements a reduced version of the BCBCI's bias correction. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, these methods were compared to the BCBCI, PBCI, and Chen and Fritz ({$<$}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"{$>$}2021{$<$}/xref{$>$})'s 30\% Winsorized BCBCI. The results showed that the methods perform on a continuum, where the BCBCI has the best balance (i.e., having closest to an equal proportion of CIs falling above and below the true effect), highest power, and highest type I error rate; the PBCI has the worst balance, lowest power, and lowest type I error rate; and the alternative bias-corrected methods fall between these two methods on all three performance criteria. An extension of the original simulation that compared the bias-corrected methods to the PBCI after controlling for type I error rate inflation suggests that the increased power of these methods might only be due to their higher type I error rates. Thus, if control over the type I error rate is desired, the PBCI is still the recommended method for use with the indirect effect. Future research should examine the performance of these methods in the presence of missing data, confounding variables, and other real-world complications to enhance the generalizability of these results.}

This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach.

Extending automation with adaptive capabilities can aid the human in overcoming cognitive workload challenges. At present, most adaptive automation research has focused on laboratory experiments and only limited research has aimed to implement and validate adaptive automation in a real-world setting. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of adaptive automation in precisely such a setting, extending the scientific knowledge base of adaptive systems with an evaluation of a real-world adaptive task. Implementing adaptive automation in a real-world C2 setting required extending current adaptive automation theories with an object-oriented task model and a hybrid triggering mechanism. The extended model was evaluated with eight naval officers using a high-fidelity C2 environment and showed an overall efficiency effect of 60\%. Furthermore, no negative side effects of adaptive automation have been found, and the data show that the scenarios were manipulated correctly. In addition, the positive efficiency effects appear most strongly in the more complicated asymmetrical scenarios (65\%). This latter conclusion shows that adaptive automation can be a valuable contribution to future C2 systems.}

The results are the first algorithms for simultaneous online estimation of contact and aerodynamic wrenches acting on the robot based on real-world data, without the need for dedicated sensors. For this purpose, we investigated two model-based techniques for discriminating between aerodynamic and interaction forces. The first technique is based on aerodynamic and contact torque models, and uses the external force to estimate wind speed. Contacts are then detected based on the residual between estimated external torque and expected (modeled) aerodynamic torque. Upon detecting contact, wind speed is assumed to change very slowly. From the estimated interaction wrench, we are also able to determine the contact location. This is embedded into a particle filter framework to further improve contact location estimation. The second algorithm uses the propeller aerodynamic power and angular speed as measured by the speed controllers to obtain an estimate of the airspeed. An aerodynamics model is then used to determine the aerodynamic wrench. Both methods rely on accurate aerodynamics models. Therefore, we evaluate data-driven and physics-based models as well as offline system identification for flying robots. For obtaining ground-truth data, we performed autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel. Using this data, aerodynamic model selection, parameter identification, and discrimination between aerodynamic and contact forces could be performed. Finally, the developed methods could serve as useful estimators for interaction control schemes with simultaneous compensation of wind disturbances.}

This paper presents a Cyber Complex Adaptive Systems approach for assessing the agility of adaptive C2 networks. Agent-based modeling is used to simulate the performance of a C2 network connecting unmanned aerial vehicles for a collaborative surveillance mission. Due to the importance of information sharing in C2, information entropy-based awareness is used to quantitatively evaluate C2 performance. Complex network methods are used to define initial network topologies and threats. Network adaptation through random rewiring is shown to recover lost C2 capabilities following network attacks, and in some cases improve performance relative to initial topologies. Inverse average path length and largest connected component fraction are shown to be important factors for maintaining C2 awareness, with inverse average path length being the better indicator of awareness.}

Boys aged 10 to 13 years (n = 617) and girls aged 9 to 13 years (n = 681) attending 25 Australian primary schools located in high or low walkable neighborhoods completed a 1-week travel diary and a parent/child questionnaire on travel habits and attitudes. Results. Boys were more likely (odds ratio [OR] = 3.37; p {$<$} .05) to walk if their school neighborhood had high connectivity and low traffic and less likely to walk if they had to cross a busy road (OR = 0.49; p {$<$} .05). For girls, confidence in their ability to walk to or from school without an adult (OR = 2.03), school encouragement (OR = 2.43), scheduling commitments (OR = 0.41), and parent-perceived convenience of driving (OR = 0.24) were significantly associated (p {$<$} .05) with walking. Irrespective of gender and proximity to school, child-perceived convenience of walking (boys OR = 2.17 and girls OR = 1.84) and preference to walk to school (child perceived, boys OR = 5.57, girls OR = 1.84 and parent perceived, boys OR = 2.82, girls OR = 1.90) were consistently associated (p {$<$} .05) with walking to and from school. Conclusion. Although there are gender differences in factors influencing children walking to and from school, proximity to school, the safety of the route, and family time constraints are consistent correlates. These need to be addressed if more children are to be encouraged to walk to and from school.}

The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of imperfect automation on conflict resolution. Twelve students with ATC knowledge were instructed to complete ATC tasks in four CRA conditions including reliable, unreliable and high time pressure, unreliable and low time pressure, and manual conditions. Participants were able to resolve the designated conflicts more accurately and faster in the reliable versus unreliable CRA conditions. When comparing the unreliable CRA and manual conditions, unreliable CRA led to better conflict resolution performance and higher situation awareness. Surprisingly, high time pressure triggered better conflict resolution performance as compared to the low time pressure condition. The findings from the present study highlight the importance of CRA in future ATC operations.Practitioner Summary: Conflict resolution aid (CRA) is a proposed automation decision aid in air traffic control (ATC). It was found in the present study that CRA was able to promote air traffic controllers' performance even when it was not perfectly reliable. These findings highlight the importance of CRA in future ATC operations.}

Meanwhile, suburban parents are using ridesharing services to shuttle children from school to extracurricular activities. Parents may soon be able to hire AVs to transport children.MethodNineteen parents of 8- to 16-year-old children, and some of their children, rode in a driving simulator in autonomous mode, then were interviewed. Parents also participated in focus groups. Topics included minimum age for solo child passengers, types of trips unaccompanied children might take, and vehicle features needed to support child passengers.ResultsParents would require two-way audio communication and prefer video feeds of vehicle interiors, seatbelt checks, automatic locking, secure passenger identification, and remote access to vehicle information. Parents cited convenience as the greatest benefit and fear that AVs could not protect passengers during unplanned trip interruptions as their greatest concern.ConclusionManufacturers have an opportunity to design family-friendly AVs from the outset, rather than retrofit them to be safe for child passengers. More research, especially usability studies where families interact with technology prototypes, is needed to understand how AV design impacts child passengers.ApplicationPotential applications of this research include not only designing vehicles that can be used to safely transport children, seniors who no longer drive, and individuals with disabilities but also developing regulations, policies, and societal infrastructure to support safe child transport via AVs.}

Some measures of constructs belonging to this group have been well studied in genetics and psychometrics, while much less is known about measures of other such constructs. The current study focuses on 7 character traits prominently featured in influential intervention-oriented and/or socialization theories of academic achievement: grit, intellectual curiosity, intellectual self-concept, mastery orientation, educational value, intelligence mindset, and test motivation. In a population-based sample of 811 school-aged twins and triplets from the Texas Twin Project, we tested (a) how each measure relates to indices of the Big Five personality traits, (b) how the measures relate to one another, (c) the extent to which each measure is associated with genetic and environmental influences and whether such influences operate through common dimensions of individual differences, and (d) the extent to which genetic and environmental factors mediate the relations between fluid intelligence, character measures, verbal knowledge, and academic achievement. We find moderate relations among the measures that can be captured by a highly heritable common dimension representing a mixture of Openness and Conscientiousness. Moreover, genetically influenced variance in the character measures is associated with multiple measures of verbal knowledge and academic achievement, even after controlling for fluid intelligence. In contrast, environmentally influenced variance in character is largely unrelated to knowledge and achievement outcomes. We propose that character measures popularly used in education may be best conceptualized as indexing facets of personality that are of particular relevance to academic achievement.

We conducted an online survey among 386 respondents. The results revealed that habitual smartphone use is an important contributor to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related smartphone use is a strong determinant for both developing habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. People who extensively use their smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of emotional intelligence on habitual or addictive smartphone behavior, while social stress positively influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men experience less social stress than women, and use their smartphones less for social purposes. The result is that women have a higher chance in developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior. Age negatively affects process and social usage, and social stress. There is a positive effect on self-regulation. Older people are therefore less likely to develop habitual or addictive smartphone behaviors.},

  abstract = {Objective This research aimed to investigate the relationship between gaze behaviour dynamics and operator performance. Background Individuals differ in their approach when learning a new task often resulting in performance disparity. During training some individuals learn the structure and dynamics of the task and develop a systematic approach, whereas others may achieve the same result albeit with increased perceived workload, or indeed some may fail to achieve superior performance levels. Previous research has shown that comparing gaze of experts with novices can provide unique insights into cognitive functioning of superior performers. Methods Twenty-five individuals participated in a computer-based simulation task. The concept of coefficient of variation (CoV) of task scores was used to compute the participants' consistency of performance. Based on CoV, the cohort was split into two performance categories. The temporal patterns in participants gaze data were transformed using autocorrelation, and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was employed to analyse and quantify the patterns. Results A Mann--Whitney U analysis demonstrated significantly (p {$<$} .01) higher determinism, entropy and laminarity in the superior group compared to the moderate group. Pearson's correlation revealed a significant (p {$<$} .01) negative correlation between the consistency of task performance (CoV) and the RQA measures. Conclusion The results demonstrated that eye gaze dynamics can be used as an objective measure of performance. Participants classified as superior performers consistently demonstrated a systematic gaze activity which were in line with the task structure. Application The methods presented here are applicable to observe and evaluate operators' strategic distribution of gaze. Specifically, for tactical monitoring and decision making in task environments where spatial locations of elements-of-interest vary continuously.},

On the defender side, there is promising research suggesting that Symbolic Deep Learning (SDL) may be employed to automatically construct cognitive models of expert behavior based on small samples of expert decisions. Such models could then be employed to provide decision support for non-expert users in the form of explainable expert-based suggestions. On the attacker side, there is promising research suggesting that model-tracing with dynamic parameter fitting may be used to automatically construct models during live attack scenarios, and to predict individual attacker preferences. Predicted attacker preferences could then be exploited for mitigating risk of successful attacks. In this paper we examine how these two cognitive modeling approaches may be useful for cybersecurity professionals via two human experiments. In the first experiment participants play the role of cyber analysts performing a task based on Intrusion Detection System alert elevation. Experiment results and analysis reveal that SDL can help to reduce missed threats by 25\%. In the second experiment participants play the role of attackers picking among four attack strategies. Experiment results and analysis reveal that model-tracing with dynamic parameter fitting can be used to predict (and exploit) most attackers' preferences 40-70\% of the time. We conclude that studies and models of human cognition are highly valuable for advancing cybersecurity.}

However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external---conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60\% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.]}

Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40\%?60\% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34\%?52\% of the variance in usage intentions.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.]}

The paper focuses on some fundamentals that make a machine autonomous: decision making that involves modelling the environment and forming data abstractions for symbolic processing and logic-based reasoning. Most relevant capabilities such as navigation, autonomous path planning, path following control, and communications, that directly affect decision making, are treated as basic skills of agents. Although many autonomous vehicles have been engineered in the past without using the agent-oriented approach, most decision making onboard of vehicles is similar to or can be classified as some kind of agent architecture, even if in a na{\"i}ve form. First the ANSI standard of intelligent systems is recalled then a summary of the fundamental types of possible agent architectures for autonomous vehicles are presented, starting from reactive, through layered, to advanced architectures in terms of beliefs, goals, and intentions. The review identifies some missing links between computer science results on discrete agents and engineering results of continuous world sensing, actuation, and path planning. In this context design tools for ``abstractions programming'' are identified as needed to fill in the gap between logic-based reasoning and sensing. Finally, research is reviewed on autonomous vehicles in water, on the ground, in the air, and in space with comments on their methods of decision making. One of the main conclusions of this review is that standardization of decision making through agent architectures is desirable for the future of intelligent vehicle developments and their legal certification.}

As 100\% automation reliability cannot be assured, it is important to understand the effects of automation imperfection on performance. In addition, adaptive aiding may help counter any adverse effects of static (fixed) automation. Using a high-fidelity multi-UV simulation involving both air and ground vehicles, two experiments examined the effects of automation reliability and adaptive automation on human-system performance with different levels of task load. In Experiment 1, participants performed a reconnaissance mission while assisted with an automatic target recognition (ATR) system whose reliability was low, medium, or high. Overall human-robot team performance was higher than with either human or ATR performance alone. In Experiment 2, participants performed a similar reconnaissance mission with no ATR, static automation, or with adaptive automation keyed to task load. Participant trust and self-confidence were higher and workload was lower for adaptive automation compared with the other conditions. The results show that human-robot teams can benefit from imperfect static automation even in high task load conditions and that adaptive automation can provide additional benefits in trust and workload.}

  abstract = {Careful consideration must be given to the implementation of automation into complex systems. Much research in adaptive automation has identified challenges for system implementation. A key focus of this research has surrounded the methods of automation invocation including critical events, measurement, and modeling techniques. However, little consideration has been given to selecting and implementing appropriate techniques for a given system as a guide to designers of adaptive automation. This paper proposes such a methodology. We demonstrate the use of this methodology by describing a case study about a system designed to support effective communication and collaboration between the commander and vehicle operator in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system.}

  abstract = {Many current and emerging systems require human operators to supervise multiple uninhabited vehicles (UVs) with the support of automation. Automation is not 100\% reliable; ergo it is important to understand the effects of automation imperfection on performance. This study investigated the effects of automation reliability on system performance with multiple UVs under different levels of task load. Twelve participants completed 12 ``missions'' supervising 3 (low load) or 6 (high load) UVs. Participants used one UV to conduct Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition. They were assisted with an automatic target recognition (ATR) system whose reliability was low, medium, or high. Overall system performance was higher than user or ATR performance alone. The gain in system performance with the ATR was particularly effective with medium and high automation reliability. Thus, human-robot teams can benefit from imperfect automation even under high workload conditions.}

Previous research has linked perceptions of the environment with various measures of IM, but recently concerns have been raised regarding inconsistency in measuring IM. This study used various measures of IM and aimed to address how parental perceptions of the neighbourhood environment are associated with children\&rsquo;s territorial range (actual IM), as well as how this relationship is mediated by IM parenting practices (allowed IM). A sample of 105 child/parent dyads from Vancouver, Canada participated in this study. Children (age 10\&ndash;13) wore a global positioning system (GPS) watch and an accelerometer and completed an activity diary for seven days to assess their territorial range. Parents completed a questionnaire that assessed perceptions of their neighbourhood environment and IM parenting practices\&mdash;license for IM and roaming allowance. Path analyses were used to address the research aims. License for IM and roaming allowance mediated the relationship between perceived walking facilities, crime safety, and neighbourhood relations and children\&rsquo;s territorial range. Findings suggest that future interventions to increase children\&rsquo;s territorial range should focus primarily on attitude and behaviour change among parents to grant children more freedom.},

This study is among the first to associate conflict within the project team and user resistance in the implementing organization. It is also one of the first studies to investigate the relations between different types of conflict and user resistance. Project managers may invest resources into adequately managing conflicts within the project team related to tasks in which the project team interacts with users of developed software to lower user resistance. Project with poorly defined roles (e.g., agile and information security projects) may be more prone to user resistance than projects with clearly defined roles.}

  abstract = {When interacting with complex systems, the manner in which an operator trusts automation influences system performance. Recent studies have demonstrated that people tend to apply trust broadly rather than exhibiting specific trust in each component of the system in a calibrated manner (e.g. Keller \& Rice, 2010). While this System--Wide Trust effect has been established for basic situations such as judging gauges, it has not been studied in realistic settings such as collaboration with autonomous agents in a multi-agent system. This study utilized a multiple UAV control simulation, to explore how people apply trust in multi autonomous agents in a supervisory control setting. Participants interacted with four UAVs that utilized automated target recognition (ATR) systems to identify targets as enemy or friendly. When one of the autonomous agents was inaccurate and performance information was provided, participants were 1) less accurate, 2) more likely to verify the ATR's determination, 3) spent more time verifying images, and 4) rated the other systems as less trustworthy even though they were 100\% correct. These findings support previous work that demonstrated the prevalence of system-wide trust and expand the conditions in which system-wide trust strategies are applied. This work suggests that multi-agent systems should provide carefully designed cues and training to mitigate the system-wide trust effect.}

However, the neural mechanisms of grit remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the association between grit and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in 217 healthy adolescent students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We found that an individual's grit was negatively related to the regional fALFF in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which is involved in self-regulation, planning, goal setting and maintenance, and counterfactual thinking for reflecting on past failures. The results persisted even after the effects of general intelligence and the `big five' personality traits were adjusted for. More importantly, the fALFF of the right DMPFC played a mediating role in the association between grit and academic performance. Overall, these findings reveal regional fALFF as a neural basis of grit and highlight the right DMPFC as a neural link between grit and academic performance.}

However, these automated systems are not perfectly reliable. Previous studies have found that participants often do not rely properly on such systems and consequently their identification performance was not improved by them. We present an experiment that tested the effectiveness of providing aid reliability information to support participants' appropriate trust in and reliance on a CID aid. The results indicated that participants had difficulty in estimating the aid reliability. Participants who were not informed of the aid reliability trusted in and relied on the aid feedback less than those who were aware of the aid reliability. Providing the aid reliability information led to more appropriate reliance on the aid. This research has implications for the design of interfaces for individual CID systems and the training of infantry soldiers.}

In this article, a pretrained proximal policy optimization (PPO) with reward shaping algorithm, which does not require an accurate model, is proposed to solve the guidance problem of manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Continuous action reward function and position reward function are presented, by which the training speed is increased and the performance of the generated trajectory is improved. Using pretrained PPO, a new agent can be trained efficiently for a new task. A reinforcement learning framework is built, in which an agent can be trained to generate a reference trajectory or a series of guidance instructions. General simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the training efficiency and trajectory performance. The carrier-based aircraft approach simulation is carried out to prove the application value of the proposed approach.}

Accordingly, by drawing on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, we explain how individuals' positivity can result in their flourishment and development in any aspect of life, including L2 learning and teaching. Then, we introduce and conceptualize seven instances of positive psychology variables, namely academic engagement, emotion regulation, enjoyment, grit, loving pedagogy, resilience, and well-being and explain how these positive factors contribute to desirable L2 learning and teaching experiences. Subsequently, potential theoretical and pedagogical implications are drawn to enhance the quality and effectiveness of language education systems and their respective stakeholders. In the end, the limitations of the studies in this area are explicated, and suggestions for future research are provided to expand the extant literature on positive psychology in the domain of L2 education.}

One overlooked risk factor for distracted driving is the perceived attachment that one feels toward his or her phone. Prior research has suggested that individuals develop bonds toward objects, and qualitative research suggests that the bond between young drivers and their phones can be strong. It follows that individuals who perceive a strong attachment to their phone would be more likely to use it, even when driving.\&lt;h4\&gt;Method\&lt;/h4\&gt;In a nationally representative sample of young drivers (17-28 years), participants (n = 1,006) completed a survey about driving behaviors and phone use.

A structural equation model analysis showed that: (1) social support has a significant positive predictive effect on academic performance and (2) dispositional optimism has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between social support and academic performance. Further, a moderated mediation effect test showed that grit moderates (3) the direct social support effect on academic performance as well as (4) the direct and indirect pathways among social support, dispositional optimism, and academic performance. The results indicate that social support is conducive to the development of dispositional optimism in children from low-income families, thereby improving their academic performance. At the same time, grit can enhance the positive impact of optimism on the academic performance of children from low-income families. This study has important theoretical and practical implications for effectively improving the academic performance of children from low-income families.}

Focusing on the experimental application of autonomous social robots, the article explores: (i) the rationale for urban robotic experiments and the interests involved, and (ii) the challenges and outcomes of creating meaningful urban spaces for robotic experimentation. The article makes a distinctive contribution to urban research by illuminating a potentially far-reaching but under-researched area of urban policy. It provides a conceptual framework for mapping and understanding the highly contingent, spatially uneven and socially selective processes of robotic urban experimentation.}

Here, we highlight current, state-of-the-art methods, including digital-compass measurements and field data collection with mobile devices, which facilitate crowdsourcing by novice geologists. Crowd-sourced collection of field data is advocated as a means of assembling big datasets for the construction of detailed geologic maps. However, expert control of field data is necessary to address inconsistencies in crowd-sourced novice datasets. Digital compasses on mobile devices can facilitate collection of field data by less-experienced geologists. However, concerns exist regarding instrument-related data quality. We incorporate discussions of statistical methods that are relevant to evaluating the precision and accuracy of digital compasses as compared with analogue compasses. All compass platforms tested (Brunton Pocket Transits, iPhones, iPads, and Android-based phones) exhibited inconstancies in precision. However, the least reliable were Android-based devices. We argue that redundancy in measurements, coupled with assessing instrument drift through time, is necessary for all types of compasses. Statistical evaluation of compass measurements and other field data is arguably an important component of future mapping and data collection methods, as we adapt to the opportunities and challenges of assembling massive field datasets.},

  abstract = {Function allocation between human and automation can be represented in terms of the stages \& levels taxonomy proposed by Parasuraman, Sheridan \& Wickens (2000). Higher degrees of automation (DOA) are achieved both by later stages (e.g., automation decision aiding rather than diagnostic aiding) and higher levels within stages (e.g. executing a choice unless vetoed, versus offering the human several choices). A meta analysis based on data of 14 experiments examines the mediating effects of DOA on routine system performance, performance when the automation fails, workload and situation awareness. The effects of DOA on these four measures are summarized by level of statistical significance. We found: (1) an inverse relationship between routine performance and workload as automation is introduced and DOA increases. (2) a weak positive relationship between routine performance and failure performance, as mediated by DOA. (3) A strong mediating role of situation awareness in improving both routine and failure performance.}

Participants (N = 131) completed a two-hour simulated multi-UAV mission assisted by an automated decision making aid of either high or low reliability. A decrease in subjective task engagement and performance over time marked the induction of passive fatigue by the mission. Participants were more trusting in the high reliability condition than in the low reliability condition. Finally, reliance decreased with time at any reliability, but a significant interaction between reliability and time on task indicated that the decrease was of smaller magnitude when the automation was reliable.}

Results indicated that one aspect of grit, perseverance of effort, was a consistent and adaptive predictor for all indicators of SRL including value, self-efficacy, cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, time and study environment management strategies, and procrastination. A second aspect of grit, consistency of interest, was associated only with the latter two facets of SRL. Perseverance of effort predicted achievement before, but not after, accounting for SRL; hence, students' engagement in SRL may serve as a mediating pathway through which this aspect of grit is associated with improved academic outcomes. In contrast, consistency of interest showed no relation to achievement. Implications of the findings for additional research and instruction are discussed.}

We argue that programs such as RISE may alter the experience and impact of stereotype threat on academic achievement goals and future engagement in a scientific career. We report analyses of a national sample comparing RISE students with a propensity score-matched control group over a 6-year period. Mediation analyses revealed that while RISE program membership did not buffer students from stereotype threat, it changed students? downstream responses and ultimately their academic outcomes. Nonprogram students were less likely than RISE students to persist in the sciences, partially because feelings of stereotype threat diminished their adoption of mastery goals. We discuss how these findings inform stereotype threat and goal orientation theories and provide insight into the success of intervention programs.}

  abstract = {Fog warning systems can convey warning messages to drivers and help to reduce crashes that may occur due to the sudden occurrence of low visibility conditions. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of real-time fog warning systems by quantifying and characterizing drivers' speed adjustments under different roadway types, traffic conditions, and fog levels. In order to explore how a driver perceives the fog warning systems (i.e., beacon and dynamic message signs (DMS)) when approaching a fog area, this paper divides the roads into three zones (i.e., clear zone, transition zone, fog zone) according to visibility levels and suggests a hierarchical assessment concept to explore the driver's speed adjustment maneuvers. For the three different zones, different indexes are computed corresponding to drivers' speed adjustments. Two linear regression models with random effects and one hurdle beta regression model are estimated for the indexes. In addition, the three models were modified by allowing the parameters to vary across the participants to account for the unobserved heterogeneity. To validate the proposed analysis framework, an empirical driving simulator study was conducted based on two real-world roads in a fog prone area in Florida. The results revealed that the proposed modeling framework is able to reflect drivers' speed adjustment in risk perception and acceleration/deceleration maneuvering when receiving real-time warning massages. The results suggested that installing a beacon could be beneficial to speed reduction before entering the fog area. Meanwhile, DMS may affect drivers' brake reaction at the beginning section of reduced visibility. However, no effects of warning systems for drivers' final speed choice in the fog can be observed. It is suggested that proper warning systems should be considered for different conditions since they have different effects. It is expected that more efficient technology can be developed to enhance traffic safety under fog conditions with a better understanding of the drivers' speed adjustments revealed in this study.},

A multi-method approach was utilized. First, a subject matter expert (SME) interview was used to analyze video data of operators interacting with sAUVs. The results suggest considerations for the capabilities and limitations of the human and robot, in relation to the dynamic demands of the task and environment. A preliminary human factors conceptual model to depict and categorize these components was proposed. Next, a questionnaire was administered to sAUV roboticists (N=15) that assessed their perceptions related to the level of challenge associated to each of the factors identified in the model. The data suggest that all of the factors identified in our conceptual model are, in fact, challenging. In particular, our data suggest that situation awareness, communication, task complexity, visibility, and the robot's user interface were some of the most challenging variables in sUAV operation.}

Among predictive factors of successful learning in distance education, the effects of non-cognitive skills are less explored. Grit, the dispositional tendency to sustain trait-level passion and long-term goals, has raised much research interest and gained importance for predicting academic achievement. The Grit Questionnaire, measuring Perseverance of Effort and Consistency of Interests, has been shown to be a reliable instrument in traditional university student populations. However, the measurement and predictive validity of this questionnaire is still unknown for adult distance education university students who differ from traditional students in various ways (e.g., having a wider range of student ages). Based on a sample of 2,027 students from a distance education university, this study assessed the psychometric properties of the two-factor structure grit measured by the Grit Questionnaire. The findings suggest that the short form of the Grit Questionnaire is a potentially useful assessment tool for measuring the grit construct for distance learning higher education and that the Consistency of Interests factor is especially relevant to consider the improvement of learning performance for distance education in terms of courses credit and exam attempts. The measurement precision of the Perseverance of Effort factor, however, should be improved in future research to provide higher measurement accuracy and broader item coverage.}

Existing techniques to measure trust (e.g., subjective ratings) tend to be discrete and/or disruptive. To better understand and support the process of trust calibration, a nonintrusive continuous measure of trust is needed. The present study investigated whether eye tracking can serve this purpose. In the context of an unmanned aerial vehicle simulation, participants monitored six video feeds to detect predefined targets with the assistance of onboard automation. Automation reliability (95\% versus 50\% reliable) and priming (reliability information provided or not) were manipulated. Eye movement data, subjective trust ratings, and performance data were collected. The eye tracking data show that people visit more frequently and spend more time on low reliable automation. Priming information could also affect the participants' trust level and trigger different types of searching behavior, as reflected in eye tracking data such as mean saccade amplitude. In summary, these findings confirm that eye tracking is a very promising tool for inferring trust and supporting future research into trust calibration.}

Satellite navigation, cruise control and anti-lock braking systems (ABS) are well-known examples of automation technology used in everyday cars. The trend of automation technology being used in vehicles is expected to move closer to full autonomy through technological advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a result, our daily lives will become more and more dependent on digitally-controlled devices and vehicle systems (partially or highly automated). On the other hand, computing and digital systems also have a tendency to become more fragile and susceptible to faults and failures because of cyber-attacks and software and hardware defects, as well as accidental defects introduced by developers. Therefore, autonomous vehicle systems must be developed to bear such dangers in mind and must be equipped with defensive capabilities and measures such that they can be able to respond automatically and dynamically to both accidental and deliberate defects and attacks. In this study, autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems are examined for their cyber-security vulnerabilities. Threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are identified and classified. Development guidelines and a mitigation strategy to be used in the development of autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems are proposed and discussed in the final section.}

Such customization matches the specific tasks/expectations of a health IT system while retaining comparability at the construct level, and provides evidence of its factorial validity and internal consistency reliability through exploratory factor analysis.Objective In this study, we advanced the development of Health-ITUES to examine its construct validity and predictive validity.Methods The health IT system studied was a web-based communication system that supported nurse staffing and scheduling. Using Health-ITUES, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate users' perception toward the web-based communication system after system implementation. We examined Health-ITUES's construct validity through first and second order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and its predictive validity via structural equation modeling (SEM).Results The sample comprised 541 staff nurses in two healthcare organizations. The CFA (n=165) showed that a general usability factor accounted for 78.1\%, 93.4\%, 51.0\%, and 39.9\% of the explained variance in `Quality of Work Life', `Perceived Usefulness', `Perceived Ease of Use', and `User Control', respectively. The SEM (n=541) supported the predictive validity of Health-ITUES, explaining 64\% of the variance in intention for system use.Conclusions The results of CFA and SEM provide additional evidence for the construct and predictive validity of Health-ITUES. The customizability of Health-ITUES has the potential to support comparisons at the construct level, while allowing variation at the item level. We also illustrate application of Health-ITUES across stages of system development.}

Visual, vibrotactile, and auditory modalities were varied in the design of the experiment under four conditions: no-task, phone conversation, smartphone interaction, and video watching tasks. Driving simulator experiments were conducted to analyze the drivers' take-over performance by collecting data during the transition time of re-engaging control of the vehicle, the time taken to be on the loop, and time taken to be physically ready to drive. Data were gathered on the perceived usefulness, safety, satisfaction, and effectiveness for each TOR based on a self-reported questionnaire. Takeover and hands-on times varied considerably, as shown by high standard deviation values between modalities, especially for phone conversations and smartphone interaction tasks. Moreover, it was found that participants failed to take over control of the vehicle when they were given visual TORs for phone conversation and smartphone interaction tasks. The perceived safety and satisfaction varied for the NDR task. Results from the statistical analysis showed that the NDR task significantly influenced the takeover time, but there was no significant interaction effect between the TOR modalities and the NDR task. The results could potentially be applied to the design of safe and efficient transitions of highly controlled, automated driving, where drivers are enabled to engage in NDR tasks.},

  abstract = {Conventional null hypothesis testing (NHT) is a very important tool if the ultimate goal is to find a difference or to reject a model. However, the purpose of structural equation modeling (SEM) is to identify a model and use it to account for the relationship among substantive variables. With the setup of NHT, a nonsignificant test statistic does not necessarily imply that the model is correctly specified or the size of misspecification is properly controlled. To overcome this problem, this article proposes to replace NHT by equivalence testing, the goal of which is to endorse a model under a null hypothesis rather than to reject it. Differences and similarities between equivalence testing and NHT are discussed, and new ``T-size'' terminology is introduced to convey the goodness of the current model under equivalence testing. Adjusted cutoff values of root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and comparative fit index (CFI) corresponding to those conventionally used in the literature are obtained to facilitate the understanding of T-size RMSEA and CFI. The single most notable property of equivalence testing is that it allows a researcher to confidently claim that the size of misspecification in the current model is below the T-size RMSEA or CFI, which gives SEM a desirable property to be a scientific methodology. R code for conducting equivalence testing is provided in an appendix.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a novel control method based on interconnection and damping assignment--passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) in order to address the aerial physical interaction (APhI) problem for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The apparent physical properties of the quadrotor are reshaped in order to achieve better APhI performances, while ensuring the stability of the interaction through passivity preservation. The robustness of the IDA-PBC method with respect to sensor noise is also analyzed. The direct measurement of the external wrench, needed to implement the control method, is compared with the use of a nonlinear Lyapunov-based wrench observer and advantages/disadvantages of both methods are discussed. The validity and practicability of the proposed APhI method is evaluated through experiments, where for the first time in the literature, a lightweight all-in-one low-cost force/torque (F/T) sensor is used onboard of a quadrotor. Two main scenarios are shown: a quadrotor responding to external disturbances while hovering (physical human--quadrotor interaction), and the same quadrotor sliding with a rigid tool along an uneven ceiling surface (inspection/painting-like task).}

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel optimization technique for an efficient multi-fidelity model building approach to reduce computational costs for handling aerodynamic shape optimization based on high-fidelity simulation models. The wing aerodynamic shape optimization problem is solved by dividing optimization into three steps---modeling 3D (high-fidelity) and 2D (low-fidelity) models, building global meta-models from prominent instead of all variables, and determining robust optimizing shape associated with tuning local meta-models. The adaptive robust design optimization aims to modify the shape optimization process. The sufficient infilling strategy---known as adaptive uniform infilling strategy---determines search space dimensions based on the last optimization results or initial point. Following this, 3D model simulations are used to tune local meta-models. Finally, the global optimization gradient-based method---Adaptive Filter Sequential Quadratic Programing (AFSQP) is utilized to search the neighborhood for a probable optimum point. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated by applying it, along with conventional optimization approach-based meta-models, to a Blended Wing Body (BWB) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drag coefficient is defined as the objective function, which is subjected to minimum lift coefficient bounds and stability constraints. The simulation results indicate improvement in meta-model accuracy and reduction in computational time of the method introduced in this paper.},

  abstract = {The public's acceptance of independent autonomous vehicles and cooperative vehicle-highway autonomous vehicles is studied by combining the structural equation model and an artificial neural network. The structural equation model's output variables are used as the input variables of the artificial neural network, which compensates for the linear problem of the structural equation model and ensures the accuracy of the input variables of the artificial neural network. In order to summarize the influencing factors of autonomous vehicles acceptance, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model was expanded by adding two variables: risk expectation and consumer innovation. The results show that social influence is the strongest predictor of the acceptance of independent autonomous vehicles. The most significant factor of the cooperative vehicle-highway autonomous vehicles' acceptance is effort expectation. Additionally, risks, performance, existing traffic conditions, and personal innovation awareness also significantly affect autonomous driving acceptance. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for technology developers and industry managers to develop autonomous driving technology and policymaking.}

The current investigation replicated and extended these findings in a younger non-Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (non-WEIRD) population. Two large samples totaling more than 5000 elementary school children in China completed self-report questionnaires assessing grit and growth mindset five times over 2~years. As in Park et al. (2020, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 198, 1048892020), we found reciprocal relations between grit and growth mindset. Grit systematically predicted rank-order increases in growth mindset at each subsequent 6-month interval. Growth mindset also predicted small rank-order increases in grit over the same period. These findings suggest that, over time, behavior may exert as much an influence on beliefs as the reverse---a dynamic possibly observable as early as in elementary school and not just in WEIRD cultures.},

The analysis of experimental results indicated that workload affected operators' attention allocation and dual-task performance, but not their trust in automation. As workload increased, attention allocation on the automated task decreased and on the concurrent task increased. Moreover, an increasing workload led to longer response time for the automated task. For the concurrent task, higher workload harmed task performance accuracy but resulting in shorter response time.}

  abstract = {Background: As a personality trait, perfectionism has shown a close association with psychological disorders, such as depression. The protective effect of grit on depression has been confirmed by a series of recent studies. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the buffering role of grit in the above relationship and the possible underlying mechanism. Objective: Based on the multidimensional theory of perfectionism, we differentiated two dimensions of perfectionism as positive and negative and further examined the relationships between these two dimensions of perfectionism and depression. We also aimed to examine the possible moderating effect of grit on the above two relationships. Methods: Us a questionnaire survey approach, a total of 2,602 college students (1,608 females and 994 males) were assessed using the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale the Short Grit Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to investigate the direct effect of two dimensions of perfectionism on depression as well as the moderating role of grit in these associations. Results: After controlling for gender, age, family income, and academic performance, both positive and negative perfectionism had positive predictive effects on depression, and grit negatively moderated these two relationships. Specifically, grit completely counteracted the effect of positive perfectionism on depression yet partly counteracted the effect of negative perfectionism on depression. Conclusion: Grit prevents the depressive symptoms raised by positive and negative perfectionism.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting users' acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs, Level 3). A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR]). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users' intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers' adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public's acceptance towards AVs.},

This review concluded that there is a significant constructive correlation between teacher-learner interpersonal relationships and learners' academic achievement. Learners are required to have some sense of belonging to improve their educational performance. Moreover, other positive emotional factors such as grit, wellbeing, self-efficacy, academic engagement, motivation, and foreign language enjoyment can mediate the association between teacher-learner interpersonal relationships and learners' academic success. The study concludes with some implications for English learners, English language teachers, and English language teacher trainers. The ideas can improve their awareness of teacher-student interpersonal relationships, including teacher stroke, rapport, and teacher immediacy and their role in improving learners' foreign language learning.}

Three hundred ninety-eight participants completed a phishing email task to identify whether 40 emails were legitimate or fraudulent. The results showed that systems with feedback and high reliability improve users' performance in email identification. Users with a high tendency towards automation trust have a higher risk of phishing. However, feedback from the system helps calibrate a high automation trust tendency. These research results can promote an understanding of phishing prevention mechanisms and provide support for the design of email defence systems.},
